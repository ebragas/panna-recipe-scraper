It's resting and now it's time to make the gravy. I think gravy can seem a little bit intimidating, but I'm going to show you all the steps so you have a really flavorful, rich gravy without any lumps. The first thing I want to do is take all those amazing juices from the pain and strain them. We're going to get all of this flavor back into it. It's going to be so good. Here's a cool trick. I'm going to put this right on the cooktop, and we're going to make it right in the pan. Let's strain this off. Any solids, we want to take out of it, but again, I want to keep as much flavor as possible. I want to separate the fat from the turkey juices. I'm going to put it in a measuring cup like that, and we're going to watch the fat come to the top. If you want to speed up this process, you can actually pop this in the freezer for a few minutes and you'll watch the fat come up. The turkey juices will actually start to freeze if you leave it in long enough. All I'm going to do today though is skim the fat off the top with a ladle. It works really well. Fat does equal flavor. You hear it all the time. I want to use some of this when I put it back into my gravy. Not all of it but some. I'm going to saute my shallots in the fat. You can tell when you've gotten to the juices because the color actually changes too. Okay, great, so I've got my cooktop. I've got my pan on the cooktop and I'm just going to turn on both burners over about medium, medium-low. All of these caramelized bits on the bottom, this is nothing but flavor. You can call it [fond 00:01:43] if you want to be fancy. All that matters is that you scrape all of this off the bottom of the pan and incorporate it in to whatever you're making. Let's add some shallots. As this pan gets hot again, we're going to see it all come off the bottom of the pan. I'm going to poor just a little bit of the turkey fat back in. Maybe just like two tablespoons. Yum. So my shallots have been saut\u00e9ing for about two minutes. They're getting really soft. You can smell them. They're super fragrant. Just continue the deglazing process with a little bit of white wine. I love white wine. You can certainly use sherry. A lot of people like to use port or something sweeter and a little bit richer for their gravy. This is just kind of my go to. Let's add all this white wine and scrape, scrape, scrape off the bottom of the pan and let that reduce a little bit. Let's give it about three minutes. Once this starts to simmer, we're looking to reduce this to about a cup, so we'll be right back when I'm there. This looks amazing. It's reduced to about a cup. Here's what I'm going to do next. I'm going to add all of these juices back into the pan. The amount of flavor in here is just amazing. Then, I'm going to add a little bit more turkey stock. You can certainly use chicken stock if you didn't make any turkey stock because I want to get about four cups total. Now, I want to strain this, so you get all that shallot flavor, but you don't have little things floating around in your gravy. Let's put it through here again. Okay, good. I'm going to strain out these shallots and any other impurities that were in there. Then, I'll just give the pan a wipe to get those extra shallots out. We're going to make everything else back in this pan. Okay, great, so the pan's been cleaned out. This is where you're really going to have to pay attention because I'm going to show you how to make lump free gravy. I want both of these burners over medium-low heat. What I'm going to do is make a roux. A roux is a simply a combination of fat and flour. Today, I'm using butter. What's going to happen is I'm going to cook those tow ingredients together and they're going to thicken all these beautiful juices to make an amazing sauce. Roux are kind of the foundation of so many sauces that we make. If you're doing a cheese sauce, a bechamel sauce. I love the fact that we can do it directly in this roasting pan again, and you don't need to dirty another dish. All I need is this butter to melt before I start adding the flour. If you're gluten free, you can certainly use a different flour too. Rice flour actually works really well for thickening. There are some things you can walk away from in the kitchen, this is not one of them. You really need to pay attention because it's going to go quickly. If you want it to be lump free, like I keep telling you it will be, you got to watch. Watch this. I'm going to whisk in this butter, or flour, I should say into the butter. Add it all. I'm not looking to brown this flour. I'm just looking to cook out that raw flavor. Let's just get it around the pan. Give it a minute or two to combine with that butter. Now here's the trick, when people tell me they always have lumping gravy, a lot of times people just dump all of this liquid in at once. By adding a small amount, I'm going to continue to whisk, whisk, whisk, until it's lump free every time. Then, it's going to get to a texture I love, and I'll put the rest of the liquid in and it'll thicken up. You can see that it's bubbling and it's just a little bit brown. It's ready. It's only been about a minute and a half or two. Watch. I'm just going to add a really small amount of liquid. My whole point is that I'm trying to absorb all of this. Let's add a little more because this is a big pan. It's like Risotto, patience really pays off. Before I add more liquid, I just want to make sure this looks more like a paste then something really lumpy. This pan's so big though, it could stand to use a little bit more. I'm going to turn it up just a little bit as well. Let's get it up to about a medium heat now. We're rockin' and rollin' with it. See how this is all coming together. This is exactly what I want. The smell of this is just incredible. This is what Thanksgiving is to me. Okay, let's add a little more. You know this is right before the meal and it's really tempting to try to rush it. By this point, everybody's probably in your kitchen, looking at you saying, \"What are you doing?\" If you can have just a little patience to bring this together, you'll be glad that you did. I'm looking just to smooth out these lumps, and then, I'm going to add the rest of my juice. We're going to thicken the whole thing up. The other thing too is if you get distracted or something happens, don't worry, you can always put this through a strainer. See that. It's actually coming together really nicely. All those lumps are going away. Oh my gosh, this is going to be so delicious. Okay, let's add some more. Let's finish this up. Wow. Smells incredible. Can you see how this is smooth again? It looks amazing. Let's add just a little bit more of this. If you were to rush and put all of this in at once, you would be chasing the flour and the butter around the pan trying to get those smaller lumps out. Okay, we've got the rest of our turkey juices in the stock. Oh my gosh, look at this texture. It is honestly turning into this velvety, smooth concoction. If you have the patience, it's probably 10 minutes for this to come together like this. It's totally worth it. If you want to flavor it with anything else, you can. A lot of people that I know put a little orange zest or some kind of citrus to add to it. I do like the port instead of white wine or the sherry. This year, I'm keeping it classic. Okay. This looks amazing. Of course, I'm going to taste it and see how it's come together. The texture is incredible. It's like thick but again, there aren't any lumps. All right. It looks good, but how does it taste? Let's find out. It's amazing when you use the juices from the pan how delicious and rich it really is. I do want to season it. Get some pepper. And this actually made enough. Well, it will probably be gone if you've got eight people coming over. I was going to say it's so good for leftovers too, if you put it on a sandwich with turkey, cranberry, stuffing, the whole thing. Okay, let's taste it one last time. Just a little more, I think it needs just a little more salt, and then we're ready to go. Lumpy gravy does not have to be in your future. All you have to do is have a little patience, follow what I did, and it will be delicious. There you have it simple, classic, Thanksgiving gravy.", "equipment": [{"guid": "263f04c4-0b7e-4ecf-b067-23d753715fe1", "name": "Roasting pan (from Classic Roast Turkey recipe)", "order": 1}, {"guid": "14ecd816-08c7-4ccb-8435-908adddf9075", "name": "Fine-mesh strainer", "order": 2}, {"guid": "6de16e45-afbb-4e9f-948a-17312629bac4", "name": "Mixing bowls", "order": 3}, {"guid": "ba1c7849-f150-4d6b-831c-317789419f4f", "name": "Measuring cup or fat separator", "order": 4}, {"guid": "ee7f538e-8d78-4e60-82c7-0d9f3a28e8b2", "name": "Ladle", "order": 5}, {"guid": "113024ec-ab02-4e1e-9b9d-13eb825d4ee5", "name": "Wooden spoon or spatula", "order": 6}, {"guid": "20ecbd82-cba8-44e7-8f8b-e2296f7188fa", "name": "Whisk", "order": 7}], "masterIngredientList": {"_AAA_": [{"notes": "see Classic Roast Turkey recipe  ", "modifier": "", "name": "Pan drippings from Classic Roast Turkey", "guid": "20d6ab52-c832-4068-8cfa-ea9fc4a82313", "group": "", "imperialAmount": "", "imperialAmountRaw": "", "imperialMeasurement": "", "metricAmount": "", "metricAmountRaw": "", "metricMeasurement": "", "order": 1}, {"notes": "", "modifier": "", "name": "finely chopped shallots", "guid": "21e63bf8-abb2-4034-883e-3cf986e6bd5a", "group": "", "imperialAmount": "1/2", "imperialAmountRaw": "0.50", "imperialMeasurement": "C", "metricAmount": "90", "metricAmountRaw": "90", "metricMeasurement": "g", "order": 2}, {"notes": "", "modifier": "", "name": "dry white wine", "guid": "91da3621-510d-4816-8311-3da4ebddc620", "group": "", "imperialAmount": "2", "imperialAmountRaw": "2.00", "imperialMeasurement": "C", "metricAmount": "473", "metricAmountRaw": "473", "metricMeasurement": "ml", "order": 3}, {"notes": "more or less as needed (see Step 2)", "modifier": "", "name": "chicken or turkey stock", "guid": "b2fa2906-8bea-4700-bae8-31e9c31fee7e", "group": "", "imperialAmount": "2", "imperialAmountRaw": "2.00", "imperialMeasurement": "C", "metricAmount": "473", "metricAmountRaw": "473", "metricMeasurement": "ml", "order": 4}, {"notes": "", "modifier": "", "name": "unsalted butter", "guid": "0e858f22-212b-4081-acec-8da8dd886208", "group": "", "imperialAmount": "6", "imperialAmountRaw": "6.00", "imperialMeasurement": "Tbsp", "metricAmount": "85", "metricAmountRaw": "85", "metricMeasurement": "g", "order": 5}, {"notes": "", "modifier": "", "name": "all-purpose flour", "guid": "772280cf-190a-4b33-8a2c-27d4cfc61a53", "group": "", "imperialAmount": "6", "imperialAmountRaw": "6.00", "imperialMeasurement": "Tbsp", "metricAmount": "47", "metricAmountRaw": "47", "metricMeasurement": "g", "order": 6}, {"notes": "", "modifier": "", "name": "Kosher salt, to taste", "guid": "4725f667-ed13-450a-9192-faab56f0b897", "group": "", "imperialAmount": "", "imperialAmountRaw": "", "imperialMeasurement": "", "metricAmount": "", "metricAmountRaw": "", "metricMeasurement": "", "order": 7}, {"notes": "", "modifier": "", "name": "Freshly ground black pepper, to taste", "guid": "65c3ac34-0705-46a5-84c8-531a34d3f854", "group": "", "imperialAmount": "", "imperialAmountRaw": "", "imperialMeasurement": "", "metricAmount": "", "metricAmountRaw": "", "metricMeasurement": "", "order": 8}], "SKILLS YOU'LL LEARN": [{"notes": "", "modifier": "", "name": "Separating fat from jus", "guid": "8db03e74-74cd-49a5-a3ce-dc93616e8c33", "group": "SKILLS YOU'LL LEARN", "imperialAmount": "", "imperialAmountRaw": "", "imperialMeasurement": "", "metricAmount": "", "metricAmountRaw": "", "metricMeasurement": "", "order": 9}, {"notes": "", "modifier": "", "name": "Deglazing fond", "guid": "ee773c55-230d-4866-87ab-df3ee8aa764c", "group": "SKILLS YOU'LL LEARN", "imperialAmount": "", "imperialAmountRaw": "", "imperialMeasurement": "", "metricAmount": "", "metricAmountRaw": "", "metricMeasurement": "", "order": 10}, {"notes": "", "modifier": "", "name": "Making a roux", "guid": "1fa888d3-0c0f-4053-b314-500a096fd987", "group": "SKILLS YOU'LL LEARN", "imperialAmount": "", "imperialAmountRaw": "", "imperialMeasurement": "", "metricAmount": "", "metricAmountRaw": "", "metricMeasurement": "", "order": 11}, {"notes": "", "modifier": "", "name": "Thickening a sauce", "guid": "34a1121a-5e5b-4354-9948-8c9b5985b8bb", "group": "SKILLS YOU'LL LEARN", "imperialAmount": "", "imperialAmountRaw": "", "imperialMeasurement": "", "metricAmount": "", "metricAmountRaw": "", "metricMeasurement": "", "order": 12}]}, "steps": [{"guid": "5c481222-3478-4fc3-9f2b-00047f4391ba", "description": "While the turkey rests on the cutting board, make the gravy: Use a fine-mesh strainer to strain the pan drippings into a medium bowl, leaving behind any browned bits, or \"fond,\" stuck to the pan.

Today I'm going to show you a classic recipe that's really easy to do, and you're going to wind up with a juicy delicious turkey with crispy skin. There are just a few couple tips that are really important. The first thing we want to do is make sure that the turkey is really dry inside and out. I've already rinsed it and I let it sit for about an hour so it comes up to room temperature. Then I'm just going to use a clean towel or some paper towel to get any excess moisture off of this. I do this because I don't want to steam my turkey, I want to roast my turkey. That's how you're going to get that beautiful skin. Make sure that you get in every little crevice here, and it's just as important to do it on the inside cavity of the bird. This is a 12 to 14 pound turkey that I'm working with today. It's going to be great for eight people. I usually try to think about a pound and a half of turkey per person at the table, but I also love leftovers. If you do, don't be afraid to get one that's probably four pounds bigger than what you think you need. Today I'm just roasting this without any stuffing, which is going to make the bird cook faster and more evenly. If you wanted to add anything into the cavity, think about what you'd do with a roast chicken. You could certainly do sliced citrus. You could put herbs in. You could do garlic. Whatever you like. Here we go. This is really simple, to tuck the wing tips under. This too will help it cook evenly. You just take them right like this. Here you go. Now I'm going to truss the legs. Why do I do this? Same thing. I just want to help it cook evenly, and by doing so this will keep the bird together and help the breast cook more evenly with the thighs. Just get yourself a little bit of kitchen twine. I don't go through the whole process of trying to truss this entire thing. I think that's more for looks than anything else. All I want to do is secure the legs. I'm going to tie one over the other. That's perfect. Then I've got the giblets as well, which is basically the heart, the liver, and the neck from the turkey. Most turkeys still come with those. I love them for making gravy or stock, so save those. Now, olive oil, salt, pepper. My favorite combination for turkey. You could certainly dress it up and use any herbs that you like on the outside. But when I'm just really wanting to do something classic, I love this combination. Again, think about someone eating this turkey. You want to make sure that it's seasoned all the way around, so no matter what piece you get it tastes great. I want to make sure it's really well coated with the olive oil, and then I'm going to do the same with my seasonings. Since I'm working with raw poultry, I'm going to go wash my hands and make sure I clean it up before I add more salt and pepper. Okay, time to season. Generous, generous amounts of salt and pepper on this bird. Don't be afraid to use your hands to get the sides, which I'm about to do. Again, I think if you want to do a little combination of fresh thyme, maybe a little rosemary, that would be delicious on it too. I've done years where I go so far as to put butter under the skin, which is delicious. But I swear, every time I do it like this and keep it simple, it's so good. Let's just rub that in on the sides too so it's well seasoned. Now I'm going to move the turkey to a roasting pan with a rack. I love using a rack because again, it won't steam on the bottom. The air will circulate and it will be crispy all the way around. Then I'm going to move it to the oven at 400 degrees for 30 minutes before I turn it down. I like to start on that higher temperature because it's going to give you really crispy skin. In it goes. It's been 30 minutes. Let's take a look at our turkey. Gorgeous. If I teach you one thing about turkeys it's that when you go to check the temperature or you go to baste it, take it out, close that door. If you leave that door open you can drop the temperature of the oven 50 degrees, and every time you do that it's going to take that much longer for your turkey to cook. I'm just going to give it a quick baste. Oh my gosh. Look at it. It's already golden. It smells incredible. I'm going to turn down the oven to 325. Then depending on the size of your turkey, you're going to let it go about another two to two and a half, even three hours if you have a really big turkey. But we'll start to check the temp sooner than that. I'm basting with butter because I think it gives it amazing flavor. If you do all butter at the beginning it can tend to burn too quickly. But at this part in the process, we're golden. Literally. Okay. Back in it goes. As quickly as possible, open and close that door. I've lowered my oven to 325 degrees, and I'll check my turkey again in 30 minutes. If you have a convection setting on your oven, feel free to use it. You just want to be aware that it might cook your turkey up to about 30 minutes faster. Oh my gosh, it looks amazing. Again, remember, just close that door as quickly as you possibly can. I'm going to give it a good baste. I like to baste just because I think it continues to make the skin really crispy, and now I've got all that butter in here that's melted down. The flavor from this is going to be incredible. I'm creating that incredible base for homemade gravy. Basting might seem like it doesn't do much, but it's a really important step if you want this crispy beautiful skin. I can see in here that there are some juices in the cavity that I'd actually like to come out, because they're not as cooked as everything else. I'm actually going to very carefully tilt this pan and make sure those juices come out. Can you see that? Again, you want to make sure the juice doesn't flow out onto the counter either. That's exactly what I wanted. Okay, back in it goes for 30 minutes, and then I'll take its temperature. Okay. The turkey's been in the oven for about two hours and 45 minutes. Let's see if it's done. Well it looks amazing. You can see all of these pan juices I have which are going to make the most delicious gravy. Let's take the temperature. Super important to take it in two places, because the white meat and the dark meat cook at different temperatures. I'm looking for about 165 degrees in the breast, and 175 degrees in the thigh. Let's see what we've got. I like to do it in the center away from the bone. That's the most accurate way to get a read here. Let's take a look. All right. It's reached 165 in the white meat. Let's take a look at the thigh meat too. Again, I'm looking for 175 degrees, away from the bone. It's ready. Super important. I'm going to take this off and put it on a cutting board. That will slow down the carry over cooking that's going to happen. I want it to rest for at least 30 minutes. What will happen is, all of those juices will absorb and distribute evenly through the turkey, so when you go to slice it it's juicy and delicious. I want to transfer my turkey to the cutting board safely, so I'm going to show you a little trick. I'm just using clean towels. I'm going to pick it up. Maybe if I can just get this under it, like this. There we go, guys. Okay. All right. I'm going to quickly lift this turkey. Get it straight onto my cutting board. Then tent it with foil. Just loosely. Help keep it really juicy. When I tent it with foil it will help keep it warm and continue to cook. Just don't leave it on for too long, because you want that skin to stay really crispy.", "equipment": [{"guid": "25f71f13-71cb-453c-aee4-02e2a5717a9c", "name": "Paper towels", "order": 1}, {"guid": "2e3b8402-cb73-4f4c-8f10-3220455b15fa", "name": "Rimmed baking sheet", "order": 2}, {"guid": "2a969b2b-3811-4469-8b0a-98b017d3ae2e", "name": "Wire rack", "order": 3}, {"guid": "1081c674-cec0-4d8f-b0e4-d642c40aac08", "name": "Large roasting pan with rack", "order": 4}, {"guid": "6e0f224e-53ac-4d5e-a42d-ecccb6a68c82", "name": "Kitchen twine", "order": 5}, {"guid": "29540298-f4f4-4152-8abe-fe9155ad4463", "name": "Pastry brush", "order": 6}, {"guid": "dd0dea64-22d0-46b7-b387-9ef59336658c", "name": "Baster", "order": 7}, {"guid": "eb4463c3-d8f6-461f-b9a9-76a675e29ea6", "name": "Instant-read thermometer", "order": 8}, {"guid": "5fb4ae6a-6028-4892-af85-d23f578fd381", "name": "Kitchen towels", "order": 9}, {"guid": "3fa09037-9290-4e0b-91b1-d95042e35a89", "name": "Aluminum foil", "order": 10}], "masterIngredientList": {"_AAA_": [{"notes": "5\u00bd\u20136 kg; neck and giblets removed; reserve for gravy, optional", "modifier": "", "name": "whole turkey, fresh (12\u201314 lb)", "guid": "69a30cff-53d4-4788-8958-3734ed79bfc6", "group": "", "imperialAmount": "1", "imperialAmountRaw": "1.00", "imperialMeasurement": "", "metricAmount": "", "metricAmountRaw": "", "metricMeasurement": "", "order": 1}, {"notes": "", "modifier": "", "name": "olive oil, plus more as needed", "guid": "df1231ce-95c1-4e6d-b765-23ca5409cb05", "group": "", "imperialAmount": "1/4", "imperialAmountRaw": "0.25", "imperialMeasurement": "C", "metricAmount": "59", "metricAmountRaw": "59", "metricMeasurement": "ml", "order": 2}, {"notes": "", "modifier": "", "name": "kosher salt", "guid": "7f712aec-07e4-4f09-8a8e-8f89436ead64", "group": "", "imperialAmount": "", "imperialAmountRaw": "", "imperialMeasurement": "", "metricAmount": "", "metricAmountRaw": "", "metricMeasurement": "", "order": 3}, {"notes": "", "modifier": "", "name": "Freshly ground black pepper", "guid": "638083a6-6918-47a3-99c6-2f71fc27c21f", "group": "", "imperialAmount": "", "imperialAmountRaw": "", "imperialMeasurement": "", "metricAmount": "", "metricAmountRaw": "", "metricMeasurement": "", "order": 4}, {"notes": "", "modifier": "", "name": "unsalted butter (1 stick), melted", "guid": "09725b40-85fe-456c-af42-5b8fb4d94177", "group": "", "imperialAmount": "8", "imperialAmountRaw": "8.00", "imperialMeasurement": "Tbsp", "metricAmount": "113", "metricAmountRaw": "113", "metricMeasurement": "g", "order": 5}], "SKILLS YOU'LL LEARN": [{"notes": "", "modifier": "", "name": "Trussing a turkey", "guid": "2b99a8da-633b-43d7-861e-4e70216447e2", "group": "SKILLS YOU'LL LEARN", "imperialAmount": "", "imperialAmountRaw": "", "imperialMeasurement": "", "metricAmount": "", "metricAmountRaw": "", "metricMeasurement": "", "order": 6}, {"notes": "", "modifier": "", "name": "Seasoning turkey", "guid": "1216a643-cae9-412a-970f-a79927cb15bb", "group": "SKILLS YOU'LL LEARN", "imperialAmount": "", "imperialAmountRaw": "", "imperialMeasurement": "", "metricAmount": "", "metricAmountRaw": "", "metricMeasurement": "", "order": 7}, {"notes": "", "modifier": "", "name": "Basting a turkey", "guid": "81e91fb2-58f9-48fe-85e5-8963e270533b", "group": "SKILLS YOU'LL LEARN", "imperialAmount": "", "imperialAmountRaw": "", "imperialMeasurement": "", "metricAmount": "", "metricAmountRaw": "", "metricMeasurement": "", "order": 8}, {"notes": "", "modifier": "", "name": "Crisping turkey skin", "guid": "f73b1b5e-baa7-4a51-98f2-571d1ad0600d", "group": "SKILLS YOU'LL LEARN", "imperialAmount": "", "imperialAmountRaw": "", "imperialMeasurement": "", "metricAmount": "", "metricAmountRaw": "", "metricMeasurement": "", "order": 9}]}, "steps": [{"guid": "41f57aab-bded-4ea1-a586-211a2ce2134c", "description": "Rinse the turkey inside and out with cold water.

It's so delicious. The best part is that it's really easy to make yourself. You'll be so glad that you did. Also, I never save this recipe for thanksgiving day. You can make it a day or two ahead, so it's great. Okay, let's get started. I'm starting with an orange, which is really traditional. I love this flavor with the cranberries. I just am gonna peel the zest off. You don't want any of that white bitter part. Just like this. We're gonna leave that part behind. This will go right into the pan with our cranberries. You'll notice today too, I'm gonna use a cinnamon stick, but I love any of those warm spices with this. You can mix it up and make it your own. Okay great. Now I just want the juice from the orange. Again, this does not need to be fancy how you juice this. Squeeze it right into the bowl. You're gonna get this, kind of sweet, awesomeness from the orange, but then with the zest, you'll get a little bit more of the brightness of citrus, which I love. Okay, now see how easy this recipe me. It's gonna come together in about five minutes here. I've got sugar. Here we go. Water. Just think it out a little bit. Cranberries. Now, Thanksgiving time you can usually find fresh cranberries. If you use frozen that's fine. I just like to let the bag sit out for about an hour or two first. Let them defrost a bit, so you don't get that extra water in the pan. Okay, now I'm gonna put all of that zest right into the pan, and a cinnamon stick. Oop. And fresh orange juice. I love making this, because it's really fun. These cranberries are actually gonna pop. You'll hear it start to cook. Let's just give it a quick stir. We want everything to dissolve. All I'm looking for is to bring it up to a simmer and you'll hear that popping start and then bring it down to low, and we're gonna let it go 20 to 25 minutes, just until it thickens up. I was looking to bring this to a simmer. You can hear it and the cranberries are starting to pop. So awesome. I'm just gonna turn it down to low, and let it simmer for about 20 to 25 minutes, until those cranberries have split and it's really started to thicken. One other thing I love about cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving is that it really cuts the richness of this meal. You've got the gravy, and the stuffing and all of these heavy, rich things. The brightness and the acidity from this is gonna be perfect. It's only been about 15 minutes. I love how my cranberry sauce looks. It's thickened up. Smells amazing. I'm actually gonna give a little taste. There's one thing I teach you in these classes, it's to taste as you go and make sure you're happy. I'm happy. All right, so I'm gonna fish out the cinnamon stick here. If you like to leave it in visually, that's fine. I usually take it out. Again, this is ... If I catch you doing this, the day of Thanksgiving, something's wrong, because you can make this sauce, even two days ahead and it'll be delicious. Take out a little bit of the zest too, but it'll look really pretty if it's in the bowl. I'm actually putting it in to the serving vessel I'm going to use for Thanksgiving. Once it cools, I'll just cover it with a little bit of saran wrap and pop it in the fridge. So, there you have it. Cranberry orange relish. It only took 20 minutes to make. It is so much better than what you'd get in a can. You have to make your own.

I think a lot of people can be intimidated by learning how to make a crust, but trust me, I'm going to teach you how to do it today, teach you how to roll it out perfectly, and you are going to love this pie so much. It'll be totally worth it. The cool news is that you can make the crust two days before and bake the pie the night before too. Okay, to make the crust, I'm going to start by adding some flour, sugar, and salt to a food processor. I love using a food processor, but I'll teach you too that you could do this entire thing with the pastry blender in your hand if you prefer. This recipe makes two nine-inch disks, it's the salt, which is really cool if you want to do like some decorative cutouts on top of your pie of if you've ever going to do a double-crust pie you could use this recipe as well. Let's get our sugar in. It's always a great idea to make two crusts at once. If you're not going to use the second one at Thanksgiving you can just wrap it in saran wrap real well and throw it in the freezer, and it'll keep for up to a month. Okay, so I've got my flour sugar and salt. I just want to pulse this a couple of times to combine. Okay, now here's where we really need to pay attention. Cold butter, so important. If it's warm, it's not going to get incorporated the way I want, and all I'm going to do is put this in and start to pulse it until you get these little pieces of butter like a pea size, that's what we're going for. The important part is the more you touch it, the more you're going to warm it up, so try to keep your hands off this as much as possible. Okay, start to pulse. We do cook so much with our eyes, too, so I'm constantly looking for visual cues. I love this. This butter is getting to about the size piece that I want. Just going to pulse it a few more times before I add my water. Just looking to make sure everything looks evenly incorporated to, which it does. See how you have these little pieces of butter, nothing bigger than a pea really, that's exactly what I want. By keeping some of these little lumps of butter as you roll it out you're going to have these beautiful striations of it, it's going to be flaky. That's what we're going for. Okay, water. You want it to be really, really cold, so I just use ice water. Depending on the humidity of the room, where you are, you might need different amounts. So I'm going to start with six tablespoons of ice water and work my way up if I need a little more. Just drizzle it around the top here. Again, with crust, you're looking for all of these visual cues, so I'm going to show you what to look for right after I pulse it. I think it's still too dry, but we're going to find out. What should happen is when I put my hands in here, this should be able to come together and stick really well, but see how some of that flour is falling around off the sides. I want to add another two tablespoons and watch it all come together. I'm going to drizzle a little more over the top. You'll notice I'm barely pulsing it each time I put the lid back on, because I don't want to overwork the dough, it'll keep it from being flaky and crispy like we want. So let's just pulse it like three more times. Ooh, I like it. Perfect, I love the consistency of this. Okay, let's turn this out. I don't need a bunch of flour, but I just want to make sure that any of the buttery parts don't stick to the countertop. Just be careful with the blade, of course. I'm sure I'm not missing any good parts. Now I'm looking to bring all of this together before I shape it into two disks. Again, you want to move kind of quickly, but I'm going to chill this and give it a minute to firm up. So just cut it in half with a bench scraper, just go straight down the middle. Can you see? I mean, it's really going to come together when it chills. It's okay if a couple pieces are breaking off. This looks really good. I'll just put a little more flour down while I shape it. I think so many people get scared to bake, they think you have to be perfect. You don't have to be perfect, just practice and pay attention to the big details, like letting it chill, not overworking it with your hands. Okay, one disk down. Let's get that in here. Just wrap it really well around all sides. If you're going to put it in a refrigerator, especially with Thanksgiving things that you're prepping, you don't want it to take on the smells of anything like your green beans or your onions. So just make sure it's well-covered. I always make a double batch of this dough, because even if I don't use the second one for cutouts, you can put it in your freezer wrapped well in saran wrap, it'll last a month, then you can make another pie. Okay. It looks great. You can also kind of use the saran wrap to shape the dough into a disc, and then you're not using your hands as much either. Okay, again, really cover it well. I'm going to chill these in the refrigerator for at least two hours or up to two days. My dough is chilled for a few hours, and I brought it out for about five minutes just to soften up. Now here comes the cool part. I'm going to teach you how to roll out this dough, so it's great. Now, there are a couple of ways you could do this. You could certainly put it between two pieces of parchment paper, but I want to show you how to roll it and turn it so it doesn't stick and you get the shape you want. Again, super important to have a well floured surface. If any of this dough sticks, you're going to have to start over, which we don't want. Again, you'll notice, I'm not going to touch this dough a lot in the center, because it'll warm it up every time my warm hands hit it. I'm just going to put a little flour over the top, and here's my visual cue. This is the pie dish I'm using, and I'm going to need to roll it out to be a little bit bigger than the rim, okay? I need at least a half-inch around here. Okay, so the trick to this is making sure the bottom is well-floured, and you want to turn a lot to make sure it's not sticking. So let's start with our first roll. Just going to give it a couple ... Turn it again, quarter turn. Roll, turn. Roll, turn. Repeat. Every time I'm picking up, I'm making sure that I'm incorporating a little flour on the bottom or that it's not sticking. Let's give it one more. Okay. Once you master this, you'll want to bake everything. It's so fun, because this basic pie dough is great for like a pecan pie and apple pie. It's the dough I would use if I wanted to do a lattice crust pie. It's sturdy, but it's still going to be flaky. It's looking amazing. I love this. You really can see the striations of the butter running through it, that's where the flake is going to come from. Turn it again. Another great trick is if it does stick, just put a really thin spatula under it, pick it up, sprinkle a little flour down there, and start over with it. Let's look and see how I'm doing with the pie dish. Okay, so this is looking great. I want a little bit extra overhang so I can trim the sides and make it even. It's looking really good. What do you say we give it another quarter turn and then we'll be done. I think it looks good, let's make sure. I think it's great. I'm going to show you a super cool trick now to get this into the pan. I'm just going to roll it over my rolling pin. I mean, this is so impressive, it's so fun, it's like magic. Then, see, I'm going to take this end here with a little bit of overhang, I'm going to start over here, so you can see there will be a little bit of overhang, and I'm just going to center it and roll it right over the top. Ta-da. That looks good. So now I'm just going to kind of press it in. Again, I'm not going around the center of it a lot. This is a little tight over there, it's all right, we'll figure it out. I'm just going to trim off any excess over here. Looking for about a half inch overhang. That's good. Okay, now I'm going to tuck this under and show you how to pinch the crust. There are a million different ways to do that, I'm just looking to pinch this extra dough down right along the rim and then we'll make it decorative. You can see I'm just tucking and making sure that it's lining up with the side of this dish. Kind of pressing it down a little bit as I go. Now I want to show you how to make a decorative edge. There are a million things you can do, and the simplest one would be to just take the tines of a fork and press all the way around. I'm just going to do one with my thumbs and my index fingers and do this, I'm just going to take them like this and pinch with your thumb between it. Turn it and use that as the guide for the next one. So you get this really cute crimp on it, and it's really easy to do. See that? It looks so professional. Just use that last indentation as your guide for the next one, and then they're even. You can see, the more you do this, the easier it gets. If you give it one or two tries, I guarantee, you're going to master this crust, and you'll want to make this all the time. This pumpkin pie is going to be delicious. Okay, this looks awesome. I'm going to put it the refrigerator for 15 minutes, and then I'm going to teach you how to blind bake it. Okay, I've let it chill. It looks great. I'm just going to give it a couple pricks in the bottom. This keeps it from bubbling up at all. Now I'm going to do what we call blind baking. Going to put some parchment on the bottom. Why do we like to do this? It's because it's going to help pre-bake the bottom of the crust, where normally if you just put that pumpkin pie filling in before or all together it would get a little soggy. So we're just going to crisp this up a little bit before we put in our filling. I'm weighting down the parchment, which is awesome. You can see that I'm using rice, you could use beans, and you could just store those in a container and use them over and over again. We also sell pie weights at Williams Sonoma which you can buy and they last forever. Okay, in the oven it goes at 350 for about 20 to 25 minutes. The coolest thing about cooking in glass is that I'm going to see that it's nicely brown when I pull it out of the oven. Now for the filling. This could not be easier. I'm going to start by combining my dry ingredients, and I've got this awesome brown sugar. It's darker, which I love. I'm going to have some cornstarch and some salt, and then all of those warm spices we love so much for Thanksgiving. Cinnamon, clove, ginger, nutmeg, it's all going in. I'm going to freshly grate the nutmeg, I think it makes a huge difference, plus it just smells so dang good. Let's get it in here. God, it's amazing. Okay, let's give it a whisk. Break up any lumps now, it'll make it a lot easier when you add the wet ingredients. Here we go. I have milk, cream, eggs and the pumpkin puree. You don't have to be so exacting about this one, I'm just going to add them all. People ask me a lot, do you want to use fresh pumpkin? I actually think canned pumpkin is great. It's really packed with flavor, and you could certainly roast off pumpkins yourself, organic ones if you prefer, but they sell great organic pumpkin puree now. Just look at the ingredients and make sure you're getting one that's just pumpkin. Okay, if you want to play it safe, crack your eggs into a separate bowl. That way if you get any shells in it, you can fish them out of this, instead of the puree itself. In that one goes. You'll notice I'm cracking these on the countertop directly, it's a great way to prevent more shell from going into the bowl. All these little tips and tricks that'll make life easier for you. Okay, let's just break up these eggs a little bit. I love recipes like this when it just goes all into one bowl like this. Then slowly start to incorporate the pumpkin. Oh my gosh, this smells amazing. I love doing this pie the night before. Like I mentioned, you could certainly make the crust two days ahead, throw it in your refrigerator, and then the night before roll out the crust, blind bake it, bake off the pie, and just let it sit at room temp overnight, it'll be great the next day. See how quickly that comes together? Your filling is done. Okay, so I've been baking it for about 20 minutes with the rice in. It's looking really sturdy, and that's what we're going for. It's a little bit brown, I love that, but to brown it up some more I'm going to take out the rice. See this moisture in the bottom? We want to make sure that we bake all of that off. I've removed the rice, and I'm going to bake it for about another five, even up to 15 minutes if you need. We want it to be golden brown so it really holds that pie filling. I pulled this out of the oven about 20 minutes ago, I've let it cool, and this is the color you're looking for. It's a little golden brown, but it's not too dark. Now I'm ready to add my filling. Just going to go back into the oven for about 50 to 60 minutes. Oh my gosh, this pumpkin pie spice smells amazing. Get it all in there. I'm going to check on it after about 30 minutes, because if the crust gets too brown, that's okay, we can tent it with foil and put it back in. Away it goes. The pie has been baking for about 40 minutes. Can you see how brown the crust is? I want to tent it with foil so it doesn't get any browner. Why do I think it needs to go back in the oven? See how it still needs to set in the middle? I love this glass pie dish because you can see what it looks like on the sides, it's pretty close, but I want it to get a little browner on the bottom. This is not hard to do, I'm just going to fold some foil. I'm trying to curve it around like the shape of the dish. Just like that. Just fold it over. Let's do it again for the other side. Just wrap it around, bring these two pieces together, and pinch it. I crimped one side, now I'm crimping the other to combine the two pieces of foil. Just cover your crust like that. Put it back into the oven for about 10 minutes. My pie is out of the oven. It looks amazing. You can see that the crust is really nicely brown, but it really helps to tent it with foil for those last 10 minutes. The center is set, and you can see the crust on the bottom is really golden brown. I love this classic pumpkin pie recipe. I could eat it right now like this on its own or you could serve it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, it'd be delicious.", "equipment": [{"guid": "6de16e45-afbb-4e9f-948a-17312629bac4", "name":

They actually make a great base for a delicious gravy. So today, I'm going to show you how to make giblet gravy. The first thing I want to do to really capture the flavor is add them to some stock that I'm making. So I'm going to take everything, the neck, the liver, the kidneys, and the heart along with tradition stock ingredients. Some cold water, an onion that I just chopped in half, some celery and carrots, and a bay leaf, and some thyme. You don't need to season it with salt at this point. I'm going to pop those in. So I'm going to bring this to a boil, turn it down and let it simmer for about two hours. Then I'm going to strain it and save those giblets to add to our gravy. So I finished making my turkey stock and I've strained it. Then I took the giblets, everything except the neck, and I chopped them up finely so they can go into our gravy. Now I've taken the gorgeous pan drippings from our gravy and I just put the whole thing over two burners. And I'm going to deglaze this. You know you can deglaze with other liquids, anything like wine or even a little bit of water or sherry or Madeira. But I'm using this actual juice just to scrape up what's left in the bottom of the pan. We're trying to capture as much of this flavor as possible. I'm struggling to get up a little bit of the center part because there's not enough liquid there in the pan. So I'm just going to add a bit of water to it, see? And scrape, scrape, scrape. I want to capture all of that. There is so much flavor in this pan. I want you to get all of it in your gravy. Okay perfect, this is a lot better. So I've deglazed the pan and I'm going to pour all of this through a sieve right now. This is going to help me make a really smooth gravy. Because of the ridges in this pan, it's just not great to make it in. All the liquid is falling off to the sides. Alright. Now we're going to make the roux which is really the foundation to our gravy. So I'm going to take a little bit of the pan drippings and start my roux with that. I think a lot of times, people think you have to do a roux with just butter and flour, but any sort of fat is going to work. And why not use all of this flavor, right? So let's just skim off some of this fat, about two tablespoons. Put it right back in the sauce pan. The thing I love teaching people when I make gravy is that it does not have to be lumpy. You just need to pay attention for the next few minutes and you're going to make flawless gravy. Okay, cool. So I got my fat going. Now I got flour. If you want to make it gluten free, it's totally okay to use a rice flour or any popular gluten free blend on the market. Most of them thicken up really well. Okay, I just want to sprinkle this over the top. And I'm not looking to cook this flour so it's actually nutty, you know and really well cooked through. What I'm looking to do is get rid of the floury taste. So all this takes is about a minute. Just move it around your pan. Okay, so it's been about a minute and now we're going to add all of that flavorful turkey stock that we cooked down. The trick is to add a little bit at a time if you don't want lumps. What I'm trying to do is absorb all of that liquid into the roux before I add more. So see what happened? It's all in there. I keep saying it's like risotto. You just want to add a little at a time and make sure it's all absorbed. Don't be afraid to use that whisk. See, I get it to a point where there aren't any lumps before I add more. And if it gets too thick or too salty, you can always add a little water to thin it out. Start with the lumps and then they're gone. You can imagine though, if you poured all your liquid in at once and all those lumps come up, you're chasing them around the pan and it's really hard to make it smooth. Much easier to go with small amounts of liquid. Okay that looks amazing again. So let's add some more. You know it's really traditional in the south to add the giblets to your gravy. And another thing that's really delicious is to add cream, so we're going to do that today too. This is rich and over the top. Perfect for Thanksgiving. Because I still have these leftover pan juices, I'm going to add a little bit more into this. It's going to be delicious. Oh, yum. So rich and full of flavor. Okay, super important when you're making gravy, to taste as you go. Because you've added stock throughout the day, you salted your turkey, you added all that delicious butter or maybe a brine in it, so let's see what it tastes like now. You can always add more but you can't go back. It's really well seasoned right now so I don't want to add anything more until the end after I've added my cream. Oh my gosh, I love this. I need to add a little bit more of these turkey juices. They're phenomenal. Okay, I'm really happy with this thickness. But when I add the cream, it'll probably be a little looser again so I'm going to reduce it for maybe one more minute and then we're ready to go. Okay, so it's where I want it. Let's add the cream. Oh my gosh. It's going to make it that much richer. Delicious. And the giblets. It's kind of a recipe or dish into itself. Let's taste. The cream is unbelievable, I love this. Now it actually does need a little more salt. A little fresh grinding, a little more pepper and we're ready to go. We've made our classic giblet gravy, used all the giblets from the turkey and made that beautiful stock. And your guests are going to love it.

But I want to teach you the technique of making gravy, so you don't have to follow a recipe. Okay, let's get started. I had that gorgeous turkey, and I've taken it out and I've strained out the juices and the fat. What happens, you'll see, is that the fat rises to the top. So you can use that if you want, or you can set it aside and just use the delicious juices at the bottom. But what you're left with in the roasting pan are all of these amazing caramelized bits, and what I want to do is try to capture all of that flavor in my gravy. So don't throw this away. Don't you dare wash this pan before you do this. I'm going to deglaze it and scrape all of that up. Now, what do you want to deglaze with? I love using a wine. You could use white wine. I'm going to use Madeira today. A lot of people like to use sherry. You know, Madeira and sherry can kind of give it a deeper, richer flavor than something lighter. So let's do that. Madeira's a fortified wine, so it's going to be richer and sweeter than a typical wine you'd probably be drinking with your Thanksgiving meal. Let's put it in. I love it. It just creates kind of like a richer gravy. Get it in there, and now we want to scrape, scrape, scrape all of this off the bottom of the pan. Oh my gosh, it smells amazing. But what's happening, too, is I'm cooking off the alcohol as I do this. Gotta get this bit too. And I've already got my sieve set up, so I'm going to put all of this through here and I'll leave all of the remnants behind that we don't want in our gorgeous gravy. Okay, this looks great. Turn off the heat. Let's put this through the sieve. And this is going to be a great foundation to the gravy. Yum. Okay, next steps. I'm not going to use the turkey fat in this recipe, so I want to strain it off. I just want to be able to get to the bottom of the juices. So you know, there are those fat separators, which are awesome. It's got a spout that comes out in the bottom, so you could just separate the juice that way. But you can really just use a ladle to get the fat off the top as well. I'm just looking to get the clearest part off. That's the fat. It's funny, we associate gravy with Thanksgiving, but basically a pan sauce or anything you do when you roast a turkey is kind of the same thing. So once you learn how to do this today, I hope you'll use it year-round to really capture all of the goodness when you're roasting a bird like this. Okay. So we've got our turkey juice from roasting the turkey. And now I'm going to make a roux. You can do the entire gravy recipe in the pan. It just takes a little bit longer to do it, because you're trying to whisk around the pan and really absorb all of that flour. So today I want to show you how to do it in a saucepan. It's just going to come together faster. So I've heated my pan. I'm going to add about a quarter cup, four tablespoons of butter. Unsalted, if you can get it. And I want this to melt before I add my flour. Now, what does a roux do? A roux is simply a combination of butter and flour. And when you combine them, they're going to act as a thickener for any sauce you're trying to make. So you'll see it as a beginner for so many great sauces. But definitely when you're going to add stock or anything like that afterwards, you want to start with this. This will be perfect. But I'm going to show you the trick to make sure that it doesn't get lumpy along the way. So my butter's melted. Here we go. I'm going to sprinkle my flour over the top. I'm going to start to whisk, whisk, whisk. What I'm looking for is not to turn the flour into something that's nutty and really brown. I'm just trying to cook the flour flavor out of it. Also, one thing to note is that if you have any gluten free people in your family, or your friends, you could totally use a gluten free flour for this. I think rice flour on its own thickens really well. You can also use any other brand of gluten free flour that you prefer. So I'm going to whisk, turn it down just a little bit. This only take a minute or two. I just kinda want it to be a really light golden brown. Okay, this roux is done. So let's add the Madeira. And slowly. You're going to notice I don't add all of my liquid at once. This is the trick to not getting lumps in your gravy. Oh my gosh, it smells so good! The Madeira, ah! So rich. So you're going to see I whisk, whisk, whisk. That's all been absorbed. Now let's add all of the turkey juices that were at the bottom of the pan. It's probably super buttery from our turkey. This would be so good on a sandwich. I'm already kind of dreaming of the leftovers, of a turkey sandwich piled high with stuffing, this, cranberry sauce, lots of turkey. Ah. This looks so good. And can you see? Because I didn't add all the liquid, again, I whisked out any lumps. It's really the secret. But now I need more gravy. A lot of people are coming over. So let's add a little bit of this stock that I have. Then one of the most important things I'm going to do is taste. Because, you know, I'm working with a lot of different liquids here and they've been seasoned at different phases throughout the day. So what if it's too salty? I want to be able to affect that now. If it is overly seasoned, there are a lot of ways to solve that. You could add a little bit of milk. You could add water. Anything without a lot of salt in it. If it's not salty enough, or if you're happy with it, you can continue to add the stock that you're using, if it's got salt in it. Okay, let's taste. This might honestly be the best gravy I've ever made. I'm never making it again. Oh my gosh. So good! Just add a little bit more, then. I'm happy with the salt level. In fact, I'm going to go back and add more. So I'm going to keep it up with the stock. I'm really happy with how this looks. I think the gravy consistency is really pourable. I don't need to thicken it too much. But let's just taste it one last time. Oh my gosh. Perfection. All right. There we have it. Really simple pan gravy. And I hope, once you've learned how to make it here, that you'll make it your own after this.

I've already started by dicing some bacon, and I've got it going on the cooktop. I want to get it really crispy so when I mix it in it keeps that crunch. When you're cooking with this amount of bacon, it's really important to be careful as you season when you go, because it is really salty, which I love, but you'll watch that I'm going to continue to taste as I go to make sure I haven't over-seasoned it. Also, I love this combination of the bacon with the sauteed leeks, but one of the coolest things about making dressing, or stuffing, is that you can add what you love. Think about apples if you wanted to add a sweet component, or a nut. Do what you like. We're just going to master this recipe, and then make it your own. While the bacon's cooking, I'm going to butter my dish. This is softened butter. Don't be shy. Look how I'm going to do this. Just use your hands. If you prefer, you can also take a little piece of wax paper and bunch it up and just use that to spread it across. Make sure you get it up the sides though too so nothing sticks to this. I'm just using the dish that will go straight to the table; so beautiful this white porcelain, oven-proof. It's going to make for a really nice presentation. While I keep an eye on my bacon, I'm also going to chop some veg. Today I'm using carrots, which I love. Super sweet. I'm also going to use some leek. I just want to dice this. Again, when I work with vegetables, always be sure to give yourself a flat surface so things aren't rolling around. I'm just going to cut it in half. Dice away. You could add celery if you want to, but this carrot/leek combination is really delicious. How's my bacon? Oh, it's smelling so good! If you're ever going to multitask like this, just make sure you're close by. See how crispy it's getting? But I want to really render that fat and make sure it's extra crispy. Yum. My problem is I want to eat all of this before it ever gets to the table. I love dried fruit in my dressing, too. Sometimes I'll use dried cranberries, cherries are awesome. But I think this one's going to have a nice contrast between the sweetness of the carrots and the leeks with the bacon. Let me show you the leeks, because leeks are one of my favorite ingredients to use. You just want to make sure they're clean. I've sliced it here, but what I'm going to do, I'm not using the green part at all. I'm just going to cut those tops off. A lot of dirt tends to grow right in here. Let's just make sure that they're clean before I slice and we're not sending them into the pan dirty. These look amazing. All right. Let's slice our leeks. I'm just going for these little half moons. They're going to cook up really quickly with the carrots. They melt like butter. They're so delicious. How's my bacon? Getting crispy. I'll just give it a quick stir. See all of these brown bits on the bottom? I'm going to capture all of that when I make this dressing. It's just basically flavor upon layer of flavor here. Let's even it out again. I'm trying to crisp all of this bacon, so it's important to kind of keep it in a single layer. Okay, now all of my veg is ready, which I'm going to put in the pan as soon as my bacon's done. I want about another two minutes on my bacon. While I'm waiting for that to finish, I'm going to show you a really fun trick. Now, thyme is one of my favorites, but what do you do? Do you sit here and pluck every little leaf off? No, you don't. I'm going to show you. You hold one side of the thyme, and you're just going to pull against the leave, and look at that. Those little pieces are just going to fall right into the bowl. So just get kind of one piece at a time to work with and pull. The stems get really soft when it branches out, so if you get some of those in there, don't worry about it. It's just such an easier way to do it though than to pluck piece by piece. It works really well with rosemary, any woodsy, woodsy herb. Let's do another. It just comes right off. Such a cool little trick. You're going to impress all of your friends and family with this mean. Okay, my bacon's getting close. It's important to be patient. I'm looking for this to be completely crispy, so that's why I want to be patient. One other cool trick, I want to get the peel off of this garlic. I'm just going to give it a smash with the back of my knife and the peel comes right off. Now I've got my clove, I'm just going to cut that little end off. I'm going to give it a quick mince. I'm going to slice it, and then just cut across it and mince it. It's kind of like rough chopping, but with something smaller. You just don't want anybody to get those huge chunks of garlic. Bring it all together. It's much easier to chop into a pile than it is being scattered everywhere. Oh my gosh, it smells so good! How's my bacon? Almost ready. Okay. This is looking exactly like I want, really crispy, golden. It's great. I'm just going to use this slotted spoon, because guess what? I want to use a little bit of this bacon fat. Okay, perfect. Now you have a choice. I'm going to use this bacon fat because it's full of flavor. If you prefer, you could drain it off and use more butter instead, or even olive oil if you like. I'm going to start with this, and I'm going to add about two tablespoons of butter to this. What's going to happen is when I add my veg it's actually going to kind of deglaze the pan for me, and we're going to scrape up all of these brown bits. So be careful, because you're working with fat over pretty high temperature. Let's get these leeks in. Oh my gosh. It's so fragrant. It's incredible. I'm going to cook these down just a little bit before I add my garlic. Garlic cooks faster, and I don't want it to burn. I'm switching to a flat-sided spatula because this is going to help to glaze and pull up all of those caramelized bits off the bottom of the pan. So really get in there and make sure you scrape up all of that delicious flavor. Yum. This is going to go about seven to eight minutes or until the carrots are soft. About a minute before it's done, I'm going to put my garlic in. I'm using a country bread today. I just cut it into this cube, and I toast it in the oven for about 15 to 20 minutes at 375. What you're looking to do is dry it out and make it like a crouton, because then all of these great liquids are going to absorb, and what you're going to get on the inside is super fluffy, but crispy and crunchy on the outside. Okay, so my leeks and carrots look awesome. They're almost done. I'm just going to put a little bit of garlic in. Give that about a minute to cook. Give it a stir. This smells incredible. I'm going to give it a little seasoning. I haven't put anything in yet, because I know that bacon's going to be really salty. But I think it could use a little bit of flavor, and then we'll taste it on its own. Let's taste. That on its own is so delicious. Just imagine with the croutons and the bacon. It's going to be awesome. Okay, here we go. I'm going to show you a cool little hack. If you don't have a huge mixing bowl, you can use a big stock pot, because I want to make sure there's plenty of room in here to mix the bread with everything else that's going in. If you have a big mixing bowl, terrific. You just want a little space so you can get in and really mix this well. Okay, now let's add all of this goodness, straight over the top. Yum! Oh my gosh, it smells so good! Kind of mix that around. Let's add the bacon. Okay, great. I'm going to mix this, and then super important, I'm going to use my hands again, because I really want to feel for the texture that I like when I add the stock. I'm going to add about half of this. What I'm looking for is that I want the croutons to all absorb the liquid. I don't want them turning to mush. Let's start there. I'm going to add my thyme as well. It smells so good. Let's just start to toss with my hands. It still looks a little bit dry to me. Can you see that they're not all evenly coated? So I want more liquid. Yeah, I'm getting closer. Let's just put it all in now. Oh, this is great. I mean, I'm okay if some of them kind of crumble apart. I think it's really beautiful. I just want to make sure that each piece has enough moisture to be fluffy, but crunchy golden on the outside. Awesome. Okay, I'm going to add one last ingredient. I've got the green part of green onions. This is actually going to brighten it up a little bit. It's going to taste really fresh. Then, I'm going to put it back into my dish that I already buttered, put it in a 375 degree oven for about an hour. Make sure you check around 45, 50 minutes and see what you think. You know, I love the bacon in this recipe. It's so decadent for Thanksgiving, but you could certainly leave it out if you prefer, then just go heavier on the butter or the olive oil. Oh, so good. Here we go. So it's been an hour, and my crunchy bread stuffing with bacon and leeks looks awesome. If you make this ahead of time, it's totally fine. You can just warm it up for about 10 minutes before you take it to the table, but it's going to go fast.", "equipment": [{"guid": "790119fa-c590-4baa-b7d3-7867fbca02fa", "name": "Large saute pan",

Brining helps make your turkey really juicy, and if you overcook it a little bit, it's a really forgiving way to do it. Today, I want to show you how to make a buttermilk brine. It's so delicious, and the buttermilk does just to the turkey what it would do to fried chicken. It tenderizes the meat, adds a little bit of acid, and it is delicious. Let's start with the base for the brine. I've got some water and salt. Salt's the most important ingredient because what's going to happen is the salt's going to be absorbed into the meat of the turkey and make it really juicy. All I'm trying to do is dissolve the salt, so I want to heat it up, and then I'm going to show you a really cool trick for cooling it down, because you would never want to put a cold turkey into hot liquid. Again, you have to worry about bacteria. We don't want to do that. So let's just heat this up and give it a quick stir to dissolve the salt. A brine is something that you could make two or three days ahead. You could brine it, you could probably put your turkey in the brine the night before, and it will be just really juicy and flavorful. One thing you don't want to do is leave it in too long, because you could over-salt your bird, so follow your recipe. Okay, so the salt dissolves, and let me show you a really cool trick to cool this down. I'm just going to pop a couple of ice cubes in it. You don't have to worry about the volume of this. It's going to be surrounded by so much liquid anyhow. Trust me, there's plenty of salt in here. Okay, so now I've got my saltwater. We're going to combine all these ingredients for my brine. You could do this in a large mixing bowl. I've just got this stock pot today. Here's what's so cool. I'm going to take a big, beautiful variety of herbs and spices to add some flavor to this. I've got dried basil, coriander seer, mustard seed, black pepper, bay leaves, and garlic powder. All adding different elements to this. You know, a lot of times, I'll do star anise, cinnamon stick, black peppercorns. It's kind of like you can take this recipe in any direction you like, one you master it. Okay, now for the buttermilk. You won't see a lot of brines with buttermilk. I love it. I think it's so cool, and why save it just for fried chicken? Such a clever idea for your turkey. I think one of the biggest things about turkey is people are worried, because the meat can get really dry really fast, right? So with this, you want to take every step possible to try to keep it really juicy, and the buttermilk is the trick. Now, I'm going to add my saltwater right back into this buttermilk and give it all a stir. All right, now to get it in the brine. How do you do this? How am I going to get this bird surrounded by liquid? I'm going to take a really large stock pot. If you have a lobster pot, it would work. You can do it in any large vessel like this, even a large mixing bowl. And I'm using a brining bag. Now, if you have a big enough pot, you wouldn't have to use this bag. I don't have one where I can submerge my turkey, so this is the coolest invention ever. I'm going to put the bag in the pot. Can you see where I'm going with this? And put the turkey in, and this acts like a crazy big Ziploc bag, and it's actually going to stay sealed, so you can put this in the refrigerator and not have to worry about it leaking. So let's just get the brine in. You want to make sure it's fully submerged in this, because we really want it to tenderize all the meat. Again, I love that you do this whole thing the night before Thanksgiving. You won't be saving this until the end. I could probably just pour it all in from here. Just want to be careful. Get all that goodness. Got that. So, let's move it over here. I'm going to show you the real magic trick. It's got this little clip here I'm going to pop on at the end. You want to cover both of the locking pieces, and what I'm looking to do is squeeze all the air out of this. You want it to be able to fit into your refrigerator, right? And you also want a tight close on this. So keep pulling across. And you want it to go all the way over. You could certainly leave it in this pot, if this is all you have. If you have enough space in your refrigerator, I kind of like to pull this whole thing onto a sheet tray. Then it's easier to work with. You just want to make sure you go by maybe every four or six hours and flip it, and make sure it gets re-submerged. Okay? So into the fridge it goes. I took the turkey with the brine in the bag, and I actually emptied it into the sink, and then I rinsed my turkey. You don't want any of the buttermilk, any other spices sitting on your bird. I want to cover it in butter. And I want to pat it dry. It's super important to get this bird dry, even though it was in all of that brine, because I'm looking to get the skin really crispy. Even if it's wet on the inside of the bird, it's going to steam more than roast. I don't want that for my turkey. I like to just use a bunch of paper towel. You could certainly use a clean cloth, if you like. You know, the brine has done its job. It's seeped into the meat and it's going to be really juicy, full of all those flavors that I put into it. So we've rinsed it away. Now you proceed roasting your turkey like you would even if you weren't brining it. I'm going to tuck under these wing tips, because I want to stabilize it when I carve it, and it also keeps the tips from burning. I truss the legs, because it's going to help the turkey cook more evenly. The whole goal is that we're trying to get the breast and the thighs to cook at approximately the same amount of time. But they get to different temperatures, and it's always tricky, so we want to help move that process along. Now I'm going to season my turkey. I start by adding some room temperature butter to the outside. You could certainly use olive oil or any other oil that you like. I prefer butter, because I think it helps the skin crisp up really nicely, and it also just creates the most delicious gravy. But use what you like. I'm going to make sure I coat it really evenly. You'll hear me say this a lot. Now that I'm working with this butter, I wouldn't use it for anything else, because I'm coming into contact with raw poultry. It's not food safe. Really coat it. Since this brine is really salty, I'm not going to season the outside of this with salt. I'm just going to add some pepper. I'm going to put this in the oven at 400 degrees for the first 30 minutes. That's really going to crisp up the skin and make it gorgeous. Then I'm going to lower it to 325 degrees and I'm going to cook it about 15 minutes per pound. The last thing you want to do is overcook your turkey, so make sure you take it out early and check the temp. This brine turkey has been in for about an hour. I want to give it a nice baste. Sometimes the buttermilk keeps it from browning quite as nicely, so anywhere where I really want to get that color, I'll make sure it's covered with the juices as well, but it's coming along really well. Now, I'm also wondering what the temp is. I want to make sure that it's coming along well, so I'm going to insert this into the thickest part of the breast, away from the bone. Yeah, we still have probably another hour. Let's check the thigh and make sure we're happy with that, too. Yup. Just to be safe, I'm going to check it in 30 minutes, okay? And again, make sure you shut that oven door every time you bring it out. We don't want to lower the temperature of the oven when we're basting or checking the turkey temperature. I think my buttermilk brine turkey is ready, but let's find out. Wow. It looks incredible. Wow, the skin looks amazing. Now, let's take the temp. I'm inserting this straight into the center of the breast meat, away from the bone, and I'm looking for 165 degrees. I got it. I'm looking for 175 degrees in the thigh, and I want to put it right in the center of it, away from the bone as well. Oh my gosh, I can see how juicy it is already. Perfect. It's right where I want it. Now it's really important to take the turkey, put it on a carving board, tent it with foil for at least 30 minutes.

If you don't, you are going to love this apple, shallot, and herb dressing. It's creamy because it's got an addition of milk, so it's almost like a bread pudding. And it's so delicious. So let's get started. I turn on my cooktop. I'm just going to add a couple tablespoons of butter. Now you could certainly use olive oil for this, but I love the flavor of the butter, especially for the holidays. I'm going to saute my shallots. I want these to get really soft, so give it like six minutes. I'm always wanting to make sure I season my food as I go. So I want to add just a little bit of salt to these to really start to build the flavor. While I keep an eye on my shallots, I'm going to chop a few vegetables that are going into this. One of them is fennel. I love fennel. It's so sweet and fragrant. Such a great addition, and it works really well with like onions and leeks. The first thing I'm doing is I'm just taking the fronds off. You know, you can use these to garnish if you want. They're great on their own. Let me show you one of my favorite tricks. This is the core, and I want to cut it out. So what I'm going to do is cut this fennel bulb in half. And then you're going to put it on a flat surface. And can you see how it runs through there? I'm just going to use my knife to cut into it at a triangle and just remove most of the core. That's the part you want to get out of there. Okay, let's do it again. Perfect. Okay, now I want this in a half inch dice, so I'm just going to cut across it. And again, I'm always looking for the flat surfaces to remain steady, so just flip it over when you lose your flat surface. I'm cutting everything in a half inch dice so everything's evenly cooked and from a presentation perspective, it looks really great that way, too. As you're working it's great to work clean. You know, you get things out of the way. You have more space. And you actually, you're a safer cook that way. Give these one more stir. And then I want to show you celery root. Okay, celery root is such an awesome ingredient. There's something about the texture that's great. It holds up to other things. Like you could mix it with potatoes, and it's delicious. I just love the flavor. It's like a little bit earthy, a little bit unexpected. But it's got this really tough skin around it. So what I'm going to do instead of trying to use a peeler is just to use a knife and run it really closely to the skin to remove any of it before I dice it. See how I'm just cutting around? Trying to get rid of any of the fuzzy part. But you want to keep as much of the flesh as possible. The other thing about celery root is that the texture stays great over days. So you could like cook it and puree it, and you could heat it up the next day and it'd be awesome. Let's go around these edges. Get a little bit more off. And what's the bottom look like? Let's just do the opposite and come at it this way. I can cut out any pieces I don't like. Now I'm going to cut this into a half inch dice as well. Cut down there, again, stable surface. And cut across. It's really a firm vegetable, so make sure you've got a good grip on it, and a steady surface. And then again, see, I don't like that one in the corner. I'm just going to get rid of the part where the roots kind of come up and it's fuzzy. We're going to add all of this at once, so I'll just make a big pile. So my shallots are cooked. I'm going to add all of the celery root and fennel. And I've also diced a McIntosh apple, which is going to give it kind of this tart, yet sweet, addition that I love. Okay, we're going to add some walnuts that I've chopped as well. Sometimes I'll add pistachios just to do something different. Those are delicious as well. I'm going to turn up the heat on this. And I just want to cook it for three to four minutes until we start to soften these veggies. So the fennel and celery root and apple have cooked for about four minutes and it's softened up a little bit. I like what I see. So now I'm going to add the bread. One of the coolest things about this recipe is that I used a baguette. But instead of worrying about cutting it up perfectly, I just tore it up into pieces. And you could even do this two days ahead. I just let it sit out at room temperature so it turns into more of a crouton. You don't have to bake it to get this texture. I'm going to add this directly to the pan. Now, you could do this in a mixing bowl, but I love that I'm using the stockpot that's big enough to mix it directly here. And I'm going to add, instead of any other dried fruit, I'm using golden raisins. You know, it just adds a lot of visual appeal that I like. I love these. Kind of something different and unexpected. Okay. Now, I want to add some different flavors. So I got sage leaves. I'll show you how to rough chop these really fast. I'm going to just stack a bunch of these sage leaves up. I like to put the largest one on the bottom. And then I'm going to roll them up and slice across. And what you're going to get is this beautiful little slice. Look at that. But you could do so many at once. It's perfect. Sage smells amazing. It smells like Thanksgiving in here. Okay, I've got thyme leaves. And let me show you a really cool trick for thyme, too. You see how it's on this stem? This works well for rosemary. Just look at the way that the leaves are growing and you're going to pull across, or against it. So we're just going to pull straight down on this. And the thyme leaves fly right off. It's so easy. Such a fast way to do it. Now rosemary would be delicious in this as well. Actually going to use a little coriander, which is going to add some earthy notes to this. The three together are great. And then one other thing we want to keep in mind is that because I'm using milk, I haven't seasoned this much, and it's really mild, so I'm going to be more aggressive with the salt and pepper than I would be typically. I really want to make sure it's well-seasoned. Now the best way to really get in here and make sure that you're really coating each of these croutons in the bread in milk is to use your hands. Don't be afraid to do that. And it's also going to help keep the integrity of the croutons themselves. So I'm going to add a little bit of milk. You could certainly use chicken stock, veggie stock if you prefer. I'm going to start to stir, and then get in there with my hands. I just want to make sure it's not too hot, since I put it in the pan where I was doing the cooking. The recipe calls for three cups of milk. You might find that you need more or you need less. One great trick is that you can mix this altogether and let it sit for about 30 minutes and then check the texture of them and see what you think. What I'm looking for is to make sure that each piece of bread is well-coated with the milk. But it doesn't, I don't want it to be soggy. So by adding a little bit at a time, I can make sure that it's well-absorbed, without overdoing it. So there's a little bit of milk left on the bottom of the pan that's going to get absorbed into the bread as I let it sit for a few minutes. Okay, I let it sit for about 15 minutes. And I'm just going to put this into my buttered baking dish. It's really absorbed the milk nicely. Again, I'm using my hands because I want to make sure all these delicious ingredients are really evenly distributed over the dressing. I'm going to kind of pack it on here. I think that's going to work. I'll even it out, don't worry. Okay, this looks amazing. I love this. I'm going to put this in a 350 degree oven for 50 to 60 minutes. What I'm looking for is that it's crispy on the outside but I'm still going to have that fluffy texture on the inside. Okay, so it's been in the oven for about 50 minutes. It smells amazing. Like I said before, if you don't have a dressing recipe for Thanksgiving, you've gotta try this apple, shallot, and herb dressing. Everyone will love it.", "equipment": [{"guid": "4259bcea-2d40-49e7-97ab-584f181caa2f", "name": "Large stock pot", "order": 1}, {"guid": "113024ec-ab02-4e1e-9b9d-13eb825d4ee5", "name": "Wooden spoon

They're one of my favorite things I make every year, so today I'm making mashed potatoes with Yukon Gold potatoes, they're delicious, buttery, fluffy and actually really easy to make. I'm going to start, I'm peeling three pounds of Yukon Golds and cutting them into about one-half inch dice putting them right into a pot of cold water, which I'll then bring to a boil. Again, something you can do ahead, you can dice all of these potatoes and just put them in a huge bowl of cold water just make sure to change that water every few hours if you do that say the morning of. You can also do it the night before and then just change it out the next morning and then put them into fresh water when you go to boil. The reason you do that is you want to rinse off the starch and you also keep them from browning. All right, perfect. Got everything off that one. Now for a little half-inch dice. When I'm working with vegetables I always want to make sure I have a steady surface. If you've got something that's really wobbly just cut an end off and now I've got that and it's a much safer way to go. Again, you can eyeball this, you just want them to cook evenly so you don't want to have huge chunks and then really tiny chunks. That's about right. Put those right into the cold water. There we go. Mashed potatoes wait for no one, you want them to be delicious pipping hot, buttery so I do this right after I take the turkey out of the oven. You know the turkey needs a little while to rest and then you're going to carve it and do all those things, so make this the last thing you do before you go to the table. I put my potatoes into cold water and make sure to salt it really well. I'm going to bring it up to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. You want to check them at about 15 minutes, they're probably going to cook until about 20 minutes, just make sure you do that little fork test and the second they're cooked through you're going to pull them and drain them. It's been about 20 minutes, so let's see if our potatoes are done. Take a look here. They're actually a great texture. I love the Yukon Golds too because they're so buttery. You can actually see they're going to hold up really nicely. They're good. They're soft but they're not falling apart, so time to drain them. One of the keys to great mashed potatoes is really getting some of that moisture out before you mash them, so you saw me strain them there, but I'm actually going to turn the heat back on and just dry them out a little bit. Cooking really is about using all of your senses. You want to look at and you also want to listen and you can hear them drying out now which is exactly what I wanted. I cooked off most of the moisture. I'm going to put them in a bowl and then teach you how to rice them right back into this pot. The key to great mashed potatoes is keeping them hot throughout the entire process. Okay, now I'm going to show you how to make lump-free mashed potatoes. They're a couple things you can do, I love using a ricer, I also love using a food mill, you can also use a traditional hand masher. The trick is you want to get out all the lumps and you don't want to overwork them. If you do they'll get gluey and nobody wants that. I'm going to rice them back into the pot, another great trick because we're just going to add all of our extra ingredients right back in. Let's put those potatoes through and look at how cool this is. I love how this just clips right on, see how they're just going to go right back in? Such an easy way to do this. You know the other thing that happens when you use a ricer is that it's incorporating air into the potatoes so they're going to be even fluffier. You don't even have to put any pressure on this. I've already riced my potatoes now they're super fluffy and I'm just going to fold in all the ingredients that are going to make them taste so delicious. Starting with just a little bit of butter. Butter is going to add so much flavor, which we love. I got this on a really low heat and again I'm not looking to overwork these, I don't want these to turn to glue I just want my ingredients to melt and be well-incorporated. My favorite thing to add to mashed potatoes, sour cream, it adds this tang and a little bit of acidity that people don't always expect and it's so delicious. So let's put that in and I'm saving the milk for last because I'm not quite sure how much I'm going to need. [inaudible 00:04:41] when your working in volume like this that you add a little bit at a time. If I put all of this milk in at once it's really hard to take it back and we don't want soupy mashed potatoes so I'm going to start slowly and then I'm going to season these really aggressively and taste, taste, taste as I go. Start there, you could certainly add cream, but I think with the sour cream they're rich enough so milk works really nicely here. I'm pretty close. I'm going to add a little bit more milk. Again, since I'm trying to keep these potatoes hot I like to work with room temp milk, or you can even heat it up a little bit before you mix it in. Look at this texture, they're gorgeous. These are right where I want them so now it's time to season. It's going to look like a lot of salt, but it's such a neutral flavor, that's a great place to start. Now pepper, the big pepper debate. I love black pepper, I love the taste of it. I don't mind if you can see the pepper in the mashed potatoes, but you could certainly use white pepper if you prefer. Just fold it in. Okay, let's taste. They're so delicious I can't even believe this, they're seasoned perfectly. I'm not going to add anything else to these. They're time to bring to the table so let's plate. Again, this is the last thing I want to do before I go to the table. You could also preheat your bowl a little bit so they're extra warm when they get to the table, also put a little bit more butter on top or garnish with maybe just some freshly chopped chives really beautiful for color. Let's get every bit out, these are going to be gone in no time. There we have our fluffy, buttery, lump-free Yukon Gold mashed potatoes.", "equipment": [{"guid": "a6a13206-3e06-40be-bd6e-cd0388ca1342", "name": "Peeler", "order": 1}, {"guid": "23619525-692e-4d74-8c27-8d9316d314d8", "name": "Chef\u2019s knife", "order": 2}, {"guid": "fb95bd3e-36b9-4120-a9c0-377fdc039336", "name": "Large pot", "order": 3}, {"guid": "12112fef-52a3-406c-9ec6-05b84533f9ba", "name": "Colander", "order": 4}, {"guid": "2f1bead8-2543-41a0-8d49-2e5e5a7be404", "name": "Potato ricer (or food mill or potato masher)", "order": 5}, {"guid": "91dc6282-72e4-4295-acd5-5eb899313ff9", "name": "Large spoon", "order": 6}, {"guid": "ddb658d0-80d2-4d06-abf8-1826c240ed42", "name": "Wooden spoon", "order": 7}], "masterIngredientList": {"_AAA_": [{"notes": "", "modifier": "", "name": "Yukon Gold potatoes", "guid": "bcc16fde-9fb1-4dd9-818f-892a67783e81", "group": "", "imperialAmount": "3", "imperialAmountRaw": "3.00", "imperialMeasurement": "lb", "metricAmount": "1.33", "metricAmountRaw": "1.33", "metricMeasurement": "kg", "order": 1}, {"notes": "", "modifier": "", "name": "Kosher salt, to taste", "guid": "4725f667-ed13-450a-9192-faab56f0b897", "group": "", "imperialAmount": "", "imperialAmountRaw": "", "imperialMeasurement": "", "metricAmount": "", "metricAmountRaw": "", "metricMeasurement": "", "order": 2}, {"notes": "plus additional for garnish (optional)", "modifier": "", "name": "unsalted butter (1 stick), room temperature", "guid": "6b766a9f-21da-40ea-80ea-79f97d98bb25", "group": "", "imperialAmount": "8", "imperialAmountRaw": "8.00", "imperialMeasurement": "Tbsp", "metricAmount": "114", "metricAmountRaw": "114", "metricMeasurement": "g", "order": 3}, {"notes": "", "modifier": "", "name": "sour cream, room temperature", "guid": "f5a0b446-76c9-4cd4-a55c-d313b460eb4e", "group": "", "imperialAmount": "1/2", "imperialAmountRaw": "0.50", "imperialMeasurement": "C", "metricAmount": "114", "metricAmountRaw": "114", "metricMeasurement": "g", "order": 4}, {"notes": "", "modifier": "", "name": "whole milk, room temperature", "guid": "9e890243-67e5-49b3-9d72-57082d0d694c", "group": "", "imperialAmount": "1", "imperialAmountRaw": "1.00", "imperialMeasurement": "C", "metricAmount": "237", "metricAmountRaw": "237", "metricMeasurement": "ml", "order": 5}, {"notes": "", "modifier": "", "name": "Freshly ground black pepper, to taste", "guid": "65c3ac34-0705-46a5-84c8-531a34d3f854", "group": "", "imperialAmount": "", "imperialAmountRaw": "", "imperialMeasurement": "", "metricAmount": "", "metricAmountRaw": "", "metricMeasurement": "", "order": 6}, {"notes": "", "modifier": "", "name": "Chopped chives, for garnish (optional)", "guid": "c02215a1-eecf-4f39-9391-b3a5232f7ebe", "group": "", "imperialAmount": "", "imperialAmountRaw": "", "imperialMeasurement": "", "metricAmount": "", "metricAmountRaw": "", "metricMeasurement": "", "order": 7}], "SKILLS YOU'LL LEARN": [{"notes": "", "modifier": "", "name": "Checking potatoes for doneness", "guid": "6eb55cd0-c926-4e00-95e0-54aecdec31dd", "group": "SKILLS YOU'LL LEARN", "imperialAmount": "", "imperialAmountRaw": "", "imperialMeasurement": "", "metricAmount": "", "metricAmountRaw": "", "metricMeasurement": "", "order": 8}, {"notes": "", "modifier": "", "name": "Using a potato ricer", "guid": "650e143b-b48f-4f7c-b43a-728f570b9180", "group": "SKILLS YOU'LL LEARN", "imperialAmount": "", "imperialAmountRaw": "", "imperialMeasurement": "", "metricAmount": "", "metricAmountRaw": "", "metricMeasurement": "", "order": 9}, {"notes": "", "modifier": "", "name": "Seasoning potatoes", "guid": "87412b2e-5a32-4611-b1bb-4bc4025dccdf", "group": "SKILLS YOU'LL LEARN", "imperialAmount": "", "imperialAmountRaw": "", "imperialMeasurement": "", "metricAmount": "", "metricAmountRaw": "", "metricMeasurement": "", "order": 10}]}, "steps": [{"guid": "7e8a4f2c-5233-4aee-9dd2-54394522f1d9", "description": "Peel and cut potatoes into a \u00bd-inch dice.

They're called Hasselback sweet potatoes with thyme, pecans and Parmesan. They're gorgeous and everybody gets their own. What I'm looking to do is cut through to the bottom of my sweet potato, but leave a little bit intact here, so it's going to open up like an accordion. I'm looking for about an eighth of an inch cut between them and I'm going to show you this really cool trick when you get down into the center of the sweet potato. You'll always see that my hand is stabilizing. And you know what? If you really want to make sure it doesn't rock, you can always just cut a little bit off the bottom of whatever vegetable you're working with. See how steady that is now? I much prefer it. It's a much safer way to work with a knife. Okay, now for this really cool trick. If you happen to have some chopsticks around, I just have these from takeout, you can put them around the sweet potato and they're going to act as a guide, so I can cut all the way down the center here and it's going to stop my knife. So cool. Love this trick. Just cut straight down, see, and it keeps it intact. It doesn't work as well on the edges. We'll just cut right through. But for the center it's awesome. This is the hardest part of the whole recipe. Okay, so for the end I'm going to do it by hand again. You know, if you cut all the way through, it's no big deal. Just take a toothpick and stick it in the bottom and you can put your potato back together. I do love this recipe because you could do this slicing ahead of time. Get them stacked on your sheet. Cover them with olive oil, probably four to six hours before you're going to roast them off. But all I want to do now is take my potatoes, just spread them out here. Now all I want to do is generously coat them with some olive oil, salt, and pepper, and I'm going to put them in the oven at 400 degrees for 50, 60 minutes. While they're baking, I'm going to show you how to make the delicious filling slash topping for these. Just use your hands to coat it well. I just want the skin to crisp up a little bit. I think that this is the most beautiful dish that I do for Thanksgiving. It's just you don't expect them to be so stunning. And once you get comfortable with doing Hasselback potatoes, you can use any filling that you want for them. I want to just make sure to get the salt and pepper everywhere, so every bite has a lot of flavor. Okay, let's get these in the oven and I'll show you how to make the filling. Okay, now for the topping. I'm going to take about six tablespoons of olive oil. There we go, a healthy glug. Some brown sugar. You know, I love sweet flavors with sweet potatoes. I think they're delicious, so the brown sugar's awesome. It's going to add some depth of flavor to this as well. I'm just going to stir these two things together. Oh, this is going to be so good. It's really kind of a modern take on a sweet potato, but you get these really awesome flavors. The crunch of the pecans. Okay, now here's a really cool trick. I love garlic, but there's nothing worse than biting into a huge chunk of it when you're not expecting it, so I'm actually going to grate the garlic into this. This is a Microplane. It can be called a zester as well. I love this tool so much because it's so versatile. You know, you can use it ... I'm going to use it to grate the garlic, but you can use it for citrus, chocolate. I use it all the time for fresh nutmeg. Super functional tool in the kitchen. I'm just going to grate right over this bowl and I'm going to get these little pieces of garlic, so you get all of the flavor and the essence of it without the crazy chunks. If there's any left, just pull it on down. Okay, delicious. Now I have all of that garlic flavor without those huge chunks. It smells so good. Now I'm going to take some pecans. I haven't even toasted these. I just gave them a rough chop. Some Parmesan cheese. We're going to put more Parmesan on the top afterwards. It's just going to kind of melt down into it. Oh my gosh, this smells so good. I think it's the sweet, savory combo that I'm in love with. Just break that up a little bit. And you know, sweet potatoes are really neutral. I seasoned the outside out of them, but you want to make sure that this is really well seasoned, so with every slice you get a lot of flavor. For my last ingredient, I'm using fresh thyme. A really cool little trick, if you're working with any herbs that have a stem like this, works really well with anything kind of woody like rosemary as well. I got the stem and I'm just going to pull across the leaves, and they're going to fall right off. It's just so easy. You don't have to hand pick every little leaf yourself. Just pull them right off. Thyme's super forgiving. The stem is not that hard, and so it's okay if you get a little bit in your food. But I just love this trick. I'm looking for about four teaspoons total. I mean, look at that. It's so cool. You know, you could probably do this the day ahead as well. Mix all of these ingredients together, just pop it in the fridge, bring it out a few minutes before you're going to put it in your sweet potatoes. Okay, this looks great. I'm just going to give it a rough chop. In it goes. Then I am going to give it a taste to make sure it's got enough flavor. This would be so good on so many things. It's the garlic, brown sugar, Parmesan combo that's insane. It's so delicious. A little pepper, and we're good to go. My potatoes have been in the oven for about 45 minutes, so I'm going to pull them out and fill them. I mean, look at how dramatic this is. These are gorgeous. So gorgeous. It's actually a really fun way to cook potatoes all the time. You could do this with any kind of potato. Now I want the filling kind of nestled in there, and all that brown sugar and Parmesan is going to melt inside. And of course, lots on top, too. Make sure you try to get a little bit between each slice. It doesn't have to be perfect, by any means. I kind of like how chunky the pecans are. I think it looks really nice. But of course, if you wanted to chop them finer, you could. All right, I'm going to put them back in for about 10 minutes. I gave my potatoes another 10 minutes, and let's see if they're done. Oh my gosh. I'm pretty sure this sweet potato recipe is going to be the most loved thing at your Thanksgiving. They're gorgeous. They've got all of the flavors I love. They've got the Parmesan, got the brown sugar and the pecans. I think kids would love these, too, because they're just so visually appealing, and they could help you make them, which is always fun. I'm just going to get them on the platter and sprinkle a little more Parmesan on them, because why not? Make sure you're getting some of this gooey brown sugar goodness, too, that's going on. Beautiful. I just want a little bit of the gooey on here before I add my cheese. Let's finish with this.

This is a really cool version, because it's not a green bean casserole. It's lighter and crispier, and you're going to love it. I've already got a pot of boiling salted water going. I've salted it to taste like the sea. You really want these green beans to have flavor on their own. We're going to drop them in and blanche these only for three to four minutes. I don't want them to be cooked all the way through when they come out. I want them to just have a little bit of a bite. Then I'm going to pull kind of a chef move, but it's going to change your green beans forever. This is another dish that you can make ahead to this point, so you could blanche the green beans a day ahead, wrap them up in your refrigerator, and then when you're ready to serve all you're going to do is toss them with the vinegarette. Super important to keep an eye on these green beans, because I'm looking for two things: great texture with that crisp bite, and color. We want them to be bright green. I'm going to use a spider to get them out of the water. These are just like the best tools ever. All the water's going to come out, but you can transport a lot into that ice bath. Let's just use it to pick one up when you're ready to taste. These are perfect. The green beans are done. Let's get them out of this hot water and stop the cooking. It really is worth taking this extra step. All right, let's get every last bean, and then I'm going to make sure they're swimming in this ice water. There we go. Be careful, because some of them are still really hot. Nestle them on down, stop that cooking. While these cool down, I'm going to make the vinegarette. This vinegarette is so simple. I've just got a little bit of honey, which I love. Put that in here. I'm using a white wine vinegar today. You could certainly use champagne vinegar, sherry vinegar would be delicious, or you could use lemon juice if you prefer citrus. Let's just get that in here. I like to start with a little bit of liquid. See how I'm just going to break down that honey? And then add the rest of it. You know, it's a total personal choice when you're making a vinegarette how much oil to acid you use. I'm kind of a fan of a lot of acidity, so I'll do one part acid to two parts oil. That could be anything from lemon juice to the vinegar I'm using. Today I'm using hazelnut oil, which is so delicious and rich, but you could certainly use a really great olive oil here and it would be just as good. Okay, salt and pepper, super important when you're making vinegarette. Since green beans are really mild in flavor, I really love that acid kick that you're going to get from the vinegar, and again, they need plenty of seasoning. I'm going to taste as I go here. I'm going to taste with a green bean. Like if I were making a green salad, I would just dip a little bit of lettuce in it and see what I think. My guess is I'm going to want a little bit more seasoning. I want more seasoning. They're delicious. The best part of cooking is knowing that you can kind of change things as you go. I like that it's not quite so scientific, and you get to make things like you like it. Okay, I think this is going to be really delicious. One thing you don't want to do is make sure, you don't want to transfer all this water to the bowl where I'm tossing with the vinegarette, so a fun little tip here is just to put a paper towel in the bottom of it to absorb any water that comes on over. I'll give them a quick toss and get rid of that before I combine them with the vinegarette. Now let's get rid of this. This way we're really going to taste this vinegarette. I'm just going to start by spooning a little bit over. You can always add more, but it's pretty hard to take away. And don't forget these awesome tools, your hands. I use them all the time to really understand what I'm doing here. Okay, let's taste one. Ooh, I love how much contrast you're going to have with this against the sweet potatoes or something richer. It's delicious. Now to plate. I'm going to do a really beautiful presentation, but it's really simple. Let's just get these in a big pile. Since I'm doing eight people for this meal, I would actually probably plate these on two platters, because you could do it family style and have them on different sides of the table, and then people aren't waiting to pass things around. Or you could just do one big platter if you prefer. This is one of those recipes, again, I would make for lunch, do this with a seared piece of tuna or something and it's great year round. But look how gorgeous it is for Thanksgiving. Okay, love that. Now to garnish. Basil is absolutely one of my favorite herbs to work with, and I think it's because it works with so many things, but it's really sweet and fragrant. Everybody seems to love it as well. So I'm going to pinch off a couple of basil leaves and show you a really fun little trick. It's called chiffonading. Don't worry, nothing too scary, it's just a fancy way to show you how I'm going to cut these that's actually really a time saver. I'm going to stack a bunch of these basil leaves together. Let's put the big one on the bottom to catch them all. And then I'm going to roll them up and slice them finely, and then you'll have this beautiful garnish for the green beans. Just give it a roll. See what I'm going to do with my knife? I'm just going to start at one end and finely slice. Can you imagine if you're trying to do every little basil leaf on its own? This is a great trick for all kinds of herbs. You can do this with mint. I actually do this with kale, and it's awesome. Big lettuces, romaine. See, you have this gorgeous, gorgeous little chiffonade. Love that trick. Then I've already got some hazelnuts that I toasted and chopped. If you left the skin on, that would be fine too, but this is going to be delicious, and I've got lemon that I'm going to zest right over the top. So here we go. I'm going to start with some basil. Just go right through the middle. Add the hazelnut. Oh my gosh, this might be one of my favorite Thanksgiving dishes on the menu. Then finish with some gorgeous zest. Just hit it like that. When you zest directly over something, you get all of those oils, and it's just so fragrant. And there I have it, a beautiful green bean dish with toasted hazelnuts.", "equipment": [{"guid": "01beca98-211d-41fc-a6fb-a023a807d422", "name": "Large saucepan", "order": 1}, {"guid":

It seems like everybody wants them and I love this recipe so much because it takes them completely to the next level. Mashed potatoes with bacon and roasted garlic. And they're actually really easy to make. So I'm going to show you a cool trick for roasting your garlic. I'm just going to cut the tops off the head of garlic like this. You know, this is something that once you learn how to do this you'll use it for everything. I'm going to roast this garlic in the oven and the cloves are going to get so soft you can just squeeze them out. It's so delicious. It kind of mellows the flavor of the garlic a ton. You could use it in a vinegarette, you can use them in your mashed potatoes. You can spread it on crostini with other things. It's so good. So I just added a little salt on there as well. I'm just going to wrap it up tightly. I'm going to pop this in the oven at 350 degrees for an hour. This is something you could totally do ahead of time too. So I'm using Russet potatoes for these today. I've peeled them and I'm just dicing them into about a half inch dice. I've got three pounds. It's going to make a really big amount. I like Russet potatoes for a couple things. One is that they are super fluffy when you mash them. The other thing is that they've got a really neutral flavor so if you're adding any seasonings that you love, like today the bacon and the garlic, it's really going to pick up all of that flavor and it won't compete with it. So you can chop these potatoes ahead of time and keep them in cool water in your refrigerator. You'll just want to change the water every few hours to get the starches out and keep them from browning. So it's something maybe you could do either the morning of Thanksgiving or even the night before. Or, like me, you can save them until the end because I love piping hot, fluffy mashed potatoes and this is the last thing I do before I serve my meal. Okay, in they go. So I'm putting this into cold, salted water. I like the water to be as salty as the sea. You'll be surprised at how much seasoning these potatoes need. I'm going to bring this up to a boil, reduce it to a simmer for about 15 to 20 minutes, and I'll show you when they're done, okay? Now for my favorite part, bacon. I've diced some bacon and I'm just going to saute it until it's really brown and crispy. And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to take it out of the fat to drain and I'm going to reserve that bacon fat. So if you want that extra bacon flavor in your mashed potatoes you can add a little bit of it back in. Okay, my bacon looks awesome. It's crispy, it's ready to go. So I'm just going to drain it on a paper towel lined plate and, like I mentioned, I'm going to reserve this bacon fat because we might want to use a little more of it. Then I can't wait to show you what I'm going to do with all of the brown bits on the bottom of the pan. This is what's going to set your mashed potatoes apart. Oh, so delicious. If I can get through this without eating all of this bacon it will be a miracle. Okay, one of the coolest tricks. Can you see all of this caramelized goodness on the bottom of the pan? It's what we call the fond. It's smoky, it's caramelized and I want to get all of that flavor into my mashed potatoes. So over low heat I'm going to add a little bit of the half and half and we're going to deglaze this pan and it's all going to come into the half and half, and we'll flavor it with our mashed potatoes. Just add a little to start. And then start scraping with a flat-sided spoon or spatula. I want to make sure I get all of that up. Oh my gosh. It's a great trick for any pan sauce that you're making. You never want to leave that on the bottom of the pan. So find a liquid that works well with whatever you're making, whether it's chicken stock, a little bit of white wine, and scrape it up. I think I got most of it. I'm going to add the rest of my half and half to warm it up because when you're working with mashed potatoes you really want to make sure that you've got a warm liquid to incorporate. Ah, I wish you could smell this. It's the best of the holidays right here. Okay, that's good to go. So I'm going to see if my potatoes are ready. So my potatoes have been simmering for about 18 minutes and I want to see if they're done. I just like to take one out and do the fork test. Can I cut a fork through it easily? The answer is yes, they're ready to go. So let's drain these and then I want to show you, you want to make sure that they're really dry before you start to mash or rice them. Okay, so I drained these and it's really important to dry them out over medium to low heat for a minute. I don't want any extra moisture in the pan if I want these to be really fluffy mashed potatoes. So, we cook with our eyes and our ears, all of our senses. You really have to listen. I want to hear that sizzle on the bottom of the pot to make sure that they're drying out. Okay. Here that sound, that sizzle? That's exactly what I want to hear. I'm drying them out. Okay, it looks great and it's dry on the bottom of the pot. So, I'm going to transfer them into this bowl and then I'm going to actually rice them right back into the pot. I'm going to teach you how to use a ricer if you haven't used one. You know, nobody likes lumpy mashed potatoes, or at least I haven't met anybody who does yet. So there are a couple of options that you have to get really fluffy, lump-free mashed potatoes. Okay, so let's set up our ricer. Cool part is that it just fits on the edge of the pan like that and I'm just going to spoon some in and push through. This thing's so awesome. You can see how fluffy they're going to be. So I've riced all my potatoes back into the pot and now I'm going to add that half and half that we used to deglaze the bottom of the bacon pan. I'm going to start a little bit at a time because you know you can always add more liquid but you can't take it away. And, just depending on the size of your potatoes, if you weighed them or not, they're all different so let's just go easy. Okay, I know I want more. Just a little at a time. I really like the texture I'm getting. The other thing is if you overwork these mashed potatoes they get kind of gluey. So I'm trying to stir them as little as possible while incorporating these other ingredients. A little splash, another half cup there, and then just slowly stir it in. They're starting to take on that fluffy texture I love, but I want the flavor of the bacon fat so I'm going to add that next. Just drizzle a couple tablespoons over. And then, because the bacon is so salty and I'm putting that fat back in, I'm going to be really careful about how I season my mashed potatoes. You know, we salted them in the water and I want to make sure that I taste before I start adding anymore salt to these to see where I am. And don't forget, we're going to fold the bacon back in too so you're adding another salty component. Probably the first time I've ever made mashed potatoes where I didn't think I needed a ton of salt. I want to add a little bit more half and half and then I'll start to season. And then we'll add that special roasted garlic that we made that's going to really, really make them delicious. So I'm going to add a lot of freshly ground pepper. Now if you don't like the little flecks of pepper in your mashed potatoes you could certainly use white pepper. I use white pepper like once a year so I'm going to go ahead and use my black pepper which I love. Okay, so let's get after this garlic. This is one of my favorite smells in the whole wide world. But see how brown it is and caramelized? I'm just going to squeeze. So you squeeze it out of the skin and mash it into a paste. I'm just going to use my fork to mash this up. It'll make it easier to incorporate into the potatoes. Remember what I just said, I don't want to overwork my mashed potatoes. I'm thinking as I go that this is so thick it would be a little harder to incorporate it. And after I just told you not to touch your mashed potatoes too much, I want to thin it out a little bit. I'm just going to add a splash of olive oil. It'll make it a lot easier to work into the mashed potatoes. Now you know, if you didn't want to do bacon in this recipe you certainly could, but you would still want to add this garlic. It would be a shame not to. But you could bump up the whole thing by maybe steeping some rosemary in your half and half to add another flavor component. It'd be delish. Okay, here we go. Let's just add this, kind of like spoon it around. Look at that garlic. Whoa. Give them a turn. As delicious as those swirls probably are, I want to make sure that they're pretty well incorporated so you taste garlic everywhere. Oh, perfect. Okay. Taste one last time. Amazing. So good. I think I'm going to add a little more seasoning but let's add half our bacon, and then I'm going to garnish with some of it on the top. It'll get that extra crunch and people know what to expect when they taste their mashed potatoes. If these aren't your favorite mashed potatoes of all time I don't know what will be. They're amazing. Time to plate them up. I guarantee you these will be gone by the end of the meal. There will be no leftovers. If you had leftovers though they'd be amazing on a sandwich. The other thing I like to do the morning after Thanksgiving is that I'll form it into like a little patty and just fry them in olive oil in a pan and serve them with poached eggs. It's insane. It's so delish. I think I could eat these every day of my life. So I've got my mashed potatoes with bacon and roasted garlic. Yum.

One of the best things about it is that it gets better if you make it ahead of time and kind of let it absorb all the vinaigrette. So let's start by making that vinaigrette. I have some of my favorite ingredients here. One is Dijon mustard. And I love using it as a binder for my vinaigrette. It's gonna keep the oil and the vinegar together. And I've just got a white wine vinegar that I'm gonna whisk in, and then along with a little bit of honey. I think honey adds a lot of depth, a little extra flavor, and it balances with the acid really nicely. So let's get that in. People might not think they want a salad at a meal like this, but I'm telling you, it's delicious, and it's really nice to have kind of that moment in the meal that's cleaner and a little brighter. Great, so let me whisk in this honey. I love making vinaigrettes because they last for a while and you can use them in so many different ways. So one thing I always try to teach people is to season them really well. You want to add a fair amount of salt and pepper to them, bring out all those flavors. Now, if you wanted to add different aromatics, you certainly could. You know, in any vinaigrette, it tastes really great if you want to add some chopped shallots, you could certainly add fresh thyme or any other herbs that you really like too. And now I'm just gonna stream in the olive oil. And I love olive for this recipe, but a lot of people like to use nut oils, so you could certainly use like a hazelnut. That would be delicious, very festive for the holidays. Or if you prefer something milder, you could do anything from a canola to even an avocado. So, you know, people always ask, \"Are you supposed to massage your kale?\" I've never done that in my life. And I don't really think you need to. I think it comes down to how you cut it and how long you let it sit in the vinaigrette. So let me show you a really cool trick for cutting it. Just like you would chiffonade an herb, if you've ever heard that term, I'm just gonna pull it right off the stem. So see, I'm gonna grab it by the bottom and just pull against it. Out comes the rough stem. You can discard that. And you get these leaves that you can just kind of cut in half like that. Now, if you have a bunch of them, you could stack them all up. I'm just gonna roll it and then cut through it. Watch how I'm even gonna speed this up. I'm gonna cut it like that, or just fold it like that, in half. And now, just coarsely chop across it. I'm cutting it into these smaller pieces, and I think it just breaks it down. Now here's the cool part. I want to dress this kale right now and let it sit for at least 30 minutes before I take it to the table. This is gonna eliminate the whole need for this \"Do I massage my kale? Do I not massage my kale?\" You're not gonna massage your kale. I'm gonna show you why. So let's get about half of this vinaigrette on and let it just sit in it. I love to use my hands for this, because it's really the only way to know if everything's really well coated. What I'm looking for when I toss a salad with vinaigrette is that you want every leaf to be shiny and really absorb that vinaigrette, but you don't want any in the bottom of the bowl. What happens if you've overdressed it? Just add a little bit more of the greens or anything else to kind of absorb some of that vinaigrette. Okay, this looks awesome. I'm gonna show you one other trick that keeps you from having to massage the kale like everybody hears about. Let's set this aside. Give it about 30 minutes at least, and taste it. It just softens up, but it doesn't get soggy. It's transformative. I love it. I'm gonna slice a quarter of a red onion. To do that, I'm just gonna cut the end off, cut it in half through the root. I want to keep it intact. And then I think I'll just cut little half moons. Just take off the peel. And I'm just gonna use a knife that's not too thick, because I want to get really thin slices. Now you can certainly use a mandolin to do this, but I think a knife works just fine. So I'm just gonna do these little half moons. And again, you know what you can do? You can divide these with your fingers. I'm just gonna sprinkle these into the salad and put a little vinaigrette over those too, 'cause I love when they break down. It's like they're almost pickled a little bit. I'm just gonna add a little more onion. You know, it called for a quarter of an onion, but just look at how much kale you have and use as much as you prefer. Okay, now I've got pistachios that are shelled. It's gonna add that crunch we're all looking for. Pomegranate seeds, that burst of flavor and that pop. This is so festive. The colors alone, it's great for holiday entertaining. Then, if you have it, cooked quinoa, just about a cup. I love quinoa because it adds protein to so many different things. But again, it's a textural thing. We've got all these variances in texture and color, and it just adds to it. Now let's drizzle a little bit more of the vinaigrette over the top, so the other components of the salad get it. And toss it with our hands again. I just want to make sure there's enough of the other ingredients to really make sure that everyone gets something in every bite. It's gorgeous. Okay, now to plate it. I just want to make sure it's piled high and all of the goodies are shown on top too. Wow. Your guests are gonna love this. We eat with our eyes, and the colors in this are just so appealing. Everyone's gonna want to try it. There it is, kale salad with quinoa, pistachios, and pomegranate seeds.

They're called Everything Pull-apart Rolls, and they're going to change your Thanksgiving meal. The first thing I've done is that I've melted some butter with my milk. I want it to be between 105, and 115 degrees. That way I can add my yeast, it won't kill the yeast. So I've already let it cool for just a couple of minutes. Sprinkle the yeast over the top, and I'm going to allow it to bloom for about 10 minutes. Just give it a quick stir. Perfect. Watch how quickly this is going to come together. I'm going to add my flour, some sugar, and some salt. The sugar in these rolls just gives them that awesome little bit of sweetness that changes everything in the recipe, and I love it. It's kind of unexpected. I'm just going to combine these. Perfect. Okay, it's been about 10 minutes. I'm just going to add my milk, and butter, and yeast. I'm just going to mix these for about four or five minutes, start on very low to combine. One of the coolest things about this recipe is there's a few minutes of mixing, but then I'm just going to let them rise for an hour, so you can walk away, do something else. You could make cranberry relish, you could do a sweet potato or potato recipe in this time. This recipe says to allow them to rise in a warm place. When you're doing a lot of cooking this time of year, your kitchen's pretty warm anyhow. It's just going to speed up the process a little bit and make everything easier for you. If you've never made bread before, this is such a great place to start, because you're not even having to hand-knead anything. It's all going to come together, but you still get this delicious spongy dough that you will love. Okay, I want my dough to be really silky, and shiny, and elastic, and it looks terrific. Let's just get it off the dough hook. What I'm doing is just turning it into a lightly greased bowl. You could actually use your work bowl. If you prefer, just pull it out and put it right back in after you grease it. Shape it a little bit. Right in the bottom. I'm going to cover it, and then put it in one of those warm spots in my kitchen for about an hour, or until it's doubled in volume. My dough has been rising for about an hour, and it looks gorgeous. Now comes the fun part. We're going to shape them. I'm just going to put a little bit of flour on the counter, in case it sticks. You don't need much. Oh my gosh, this dough is incredible. A little on my hands. What I'm looking to do is divide this in half, and then we're going to shape this. More flour. I'm just looking to roll it into about a 12-inch log. It's looking good. A little bit more. You don't need to work it too much. I'm just trying to get the shape. Then, again, we're just going to keep dividing. So, look, I've got two fairly equal. I'm going to divide this one in half, and then thirds on each one. What happens if you don't get them perfect? It's okay. You can pinch off a little dough and add it to another roll. The ones on the end might be a little short. Let's do the same with this one. Here's where it gets really fun, because you're just playing. We're going to roll these with our hands to get these little balls, and then we're going to put all of them into the pan that I've pre-greased with a little bit of butter. We're just trying to shape them and kind of get rid of that skin, any shape there that we don't like on the top. All you need to do is put it in your hand and roll it around on the counter. Then, see, anything like that where it's open, just pull that down on the bottom. Keep turning it until you get it the way you like it. Okay, let's do another. You're just going nestle them in here, four across, and six across this way. Just use your hand again to roll it into a little ball. Oh my gosh, this dough just smells so incredible already, I cannot wait to bake these off. These pull-apart rolls are always such a hit. I'm going to cover these with saran wrap, put them in a warm place, and let them rise for about another 30 minutes. I made 12 today, but if you have more people coming over, just cut each one of these in half, and you can still fit 24 of them into the pan. I've given these rolls about another 30 minutes in the pan. They look beautiful. You can see how much they've risen and come together, thus making them the pull-apart rolls. Now, I'm going to make my everything topping. What's an everything topping? It's anything that you like. The combination I'm doing today is that I've got garlic, onion flakes, Maldon sea salt and sesame seeds. Sometimes I love poppy seeds in mine. You can do anything that gives it texture and crunch. It's like a bagel. Let's put all of these together. Then, the best part of these is that they only bake for about 18 to 20 minutes in the oven. You know what? This would be a really fun dish to do right before you go to the table, because your house is going to smell so amazing. Okay, let's just brush these with our melted butter. Be generous. Oh, they're going to be so good. You can use them for leftovers the next day, and they make the best sandwiches. Okay, let's sprinkle. You get better coverage if you sprinkle higher. If you're down low like this, you're only going to get a concentrated space, so when I'm working with a larger area, I start high. Better coverage. I mean, these smell so good. The toppings smell amazing. I'm getting all the garlic and the onion here. They'll be beautiful. You really want to make sure you get these gorgeous flakes of salt everywhere so everyone gets a hit of that when they eat them. Last drizzle. Again, 375, 18 to 20 minutes. And yes, this is a countertop oven that holds this pan. I love having a countertop oven this time of year, because when I'm roasting a turkey, and trying to do my stuffing, and bake all these things at once, it's so great to have it. These Everything Pull-Apart Rolls look and smell delicious. The amazing part is, they only take about 15 minutes of active time in the kitchen. They are totally worth making for your Thanksgiving.", "equipment": [{"guid": "4c24d1f4-8c11-4d20-9ce2-0ce179d4c797", "name": "Small saucepan", "order": 1}, {"guid":

It's a really cool twist on a green bean casserole. It's sauteed green beans with a gremolata. Let's just started. I'm just going to put this pan over about a medium heat and add a couple tablespoons of olive oil. I'm going to saute my shallots and while these cook, I want to show you how I sliced them. So I want to cook these shallots down for about three minutes just until they soften up. Another thing is I'm going to season them just a little bit. So add a really nice grinding of salt and a little bit of peeper if you'd like. These are almost ready. I just want them to be really soft and translucent before I add my green beans because that'll slow down the cooking. So the shallots look great and I'm going to add some vinegar and reduce it by half. This whole dish is really interesting because it's kind of a play on this acid, salty, sweet. It's a really delicious combination. Okay, that looks great. I'm going to add the rest of my olive oil and my green beans, and we're going to let these saute for like six minutes until they're crisp. While I wait for that, I'm going to make my gremolata. Just going to add a little salt and pepper. I'm switching to my tongs because they're really helpful when you're working with large amounts of food like this. It's a very safe way to work. I'm just looking to get these coated in the olive oil so they start to cook. Love this recipe. It's almost going to be like an agrodolce. The vinegar is really pungent but it's going to be delicious. I'm going to keep an eye on these while I make my sauce. Now gremolata is a really interesting condiment. It's served in Italy with Osso Buco so it really cuts the richness of that dish. A lot of times what you'll find in it is anchovy to give it a depth of flavor but today we're going to use preserved lemon. Super cool twist. You still get the salty acidic flavor, kind of unexpected. So I've got my almonds and I'm going to add the other ingredients to this. I've got some garlic I just want to give a mince to. The more you do this, the faster it gets. The garlic's going to go into the bowl. Check our green beans. I'm just going to give them a little stir. Oh wow, they look great! Okay. I'm just going to add my preserved lemon that I've diced right in here. I wanted to show you what it looks like. So you'll find preserved lemons a lot in Moroccan cooking. They're so delicious. They basically take lemons, pack them full of salt and let them sit for two to three months to preserve and soften up. Then you can use them in all different applications. They're great added to sauces, things like this gremolata. They just add such an interesting layer of flavor. Okay, I'm going to coarsely chop some parsley here and then get it into a little mince. This is just Italian flat leaf parsley, run my knife through it. Total personal preference how finely you want to chop it. I want it a little bit finer because I want to be able to spoon this over the green beans. I love any of these green sauces where you're adding fresh herbs, garlic, oils. You just get this level of brightness that really cuts through rich dishes. Okay, I've got this great chop on my parsley and it goes. I'm always talking about trying to keep a clean workspace but you know what? It makes a huge difference when you're working. You feel like you've accomplished something every time you clean it off, and it's a much safer way to work. So let's just give this a little stir before I add the rest of my ingredients. I'm going to whisk in a few other things. Okay, I've got my olive oil. I've got vinegar and I've got sugar. The sugar's what's going to be kind of this agrodolce thing going on and I love it. Okay, let's just start to whisk in olive oil, watch it come together. Wow! The sugar goes in. Now let's whisk it. We're just looking to combine this evenly. You'll always hear me talking about tasting as you go. This is a super important recipe to taste. It's got so many different flavors going on with the preserved lemon, the sugar, the vinegar, the almond. I really just want to make sure that it's balanced. I'm going to stir. This is just an awesome condiment on so many things. I'm thinking of leftovers. You could grill chicken or shrimp and use this. It would be delicious with that. It would be great on a sandwich. Okay, these green beans are looking awesome so I'm going to taste both things at once. Let's see how these are. I think they're still a little bit crispy. I want to cook them for about two more minutes. Let's taste the gremolata. This is so delicious, I would eat this on its own. It's vibrant, it's got the crunch of the almonds. That acid from the preserved lemon is insane. I love it. I'm not going to do anything else to this. So my green beans are done. They look amazing. I'm actually going to plate these onto two platters so if I was serving this family style, you could put them across the table and people wouldn't be fighting over them. You can certainly do them on one huge platter as well but this makes a lot. These are gorgeous. I think your friends and family will love these because they're delicious on their own like this. Then you add the gremolata and it's just what happened? There's just so much more flavor. I think I want to do just across the middle. You don't need a ton. You just want to get enough where everyone can get some of this flavor on their green beans. Oh my gosh, so good. So there we have it. A delicious twist on a classic.

And this curried carrot soup is a delicious, light way to start your meal. So let's get started. I've heated my stockpot. I'm just going to add a couple tablespoons of olive oil and some chopped shallot, one of my favorite aromatics. You know, one of the coolest things about this recipe is that it can be vegetarian as well. I'm making it with chicken stock today. You could actually make it vegan, because it doesn't have any cream in it. It's going to be super creamy when you puree it. So delicious. So I just want to give these about two to three minutes to become translucent, and then I'll add the rest of my ingredients. I love this recipe for a few reasons. One is that it's not complicated chopping. I've peeled my carrots, but I'm just going to cut them into dices. We're going to let them simmer long enough in the stock that they're going to cook down really nicely. Can you see, though, I'm always looking for stability when I chop? I don't want things rolling around on the board. Shallots are starting to smell amazing. Okay. Those look great, so let's add our carrots. The cool thing about this, too, is that it's really a formula. You start by sauteing these aromatics and adding your veggies and the broth and spices. Once you feel comfortable making soup like this, you can totally start to change the ingredients up. Give this a stir. Again, I keep saying the same thing, but so many of the recipes I'm sharing with you can be made ahead. This soup could certainly be made two days ahead of Thanksgiving and just warmed up right before you take it to the table. I'm going to add my chicken stock, but like I said, you could certainly use vegetable and keep this vegan. Okay, now I want to crank this up and bring it to a boil, then turn it down, cover it, and simmer for about 20 minutes. And I'll show you what the carrots should look like before we move on. So, my soup is cooked, and I've allowed it to cool a little bit. I'm going to stir in that orange juice. So to puree my soup today, I'm going to use an immersion blender. I love these because you don't run the risk of trying to transfer hot liquid to your blender, your blender can blow up if you're not really careful. So these are really simple to use. Let me show you. I'm just going to start here on low and start to pulse it. You'll notice I put my apron on fully to because just in case I make a mess. So you just want to start pulsing until you feel comfortable. And it's going to draw the ingredients down into the bottom and start to puree them. So, the soup looks great. Now let's taste it. So important to season as you go, and because we've made so much of this, my guess is it's going to need a little more seasoning. Oh, I love the flavor combination. The carrots are so sweet. You get that kick of curry. I love the fresh orange juice. Give it a stir. This really is such a gorgeous way to start your Thanksgiving meal. Dare I say healthy? But still delicious. So creamy, without using any cream. Great way to get people excited for the entire meal. Think I'll garnish with just a little bit of olive oil. It adds another layer of flavor, which I love. Just a little bit. And it's beautiful. A little bit on top. And since we used coriander seed in it, I'm going to garnish with a little bit of cilantro. And there you have it.

I call this one Pains Potosi because of the little village in Bolivia where I finally found, after years of travel, one perfect bread. It's a great bread for your dinner guests. It's a great bread if you just need a snack that you're going to eat throughout the day. It's a simple bread to make, it's easy. In 24 hours you have a nice thing to put on the table.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"All right, so now it's time to make the pre-ferment for the rolls and for the baguette. This pre-ferment is referred to in baker's terms as pouliche. It's a very simple starter. Usually, it's equal parts water and white flour, any unbleached flour but it's usually done with a white flour, and it's always done with a commercial yeast. If it's not done with a commercial yeast, it's not a pouliche.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"We're going to start off with 90 grams of water. I'm going to put that into the vessel. Now I put in a pinch of yeast. It's such a small quantity I can really not even give you a weight. You'd have to have a scientific scale for that and I don't think it's really necessary. This is what a pinch looks like.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"I'm going to tare my scale to zero and I'm adding in 90 grams of flour on top of the water with yeast already in it. Okay, from here I will use one of my favorite tools for small batch mixing, a chopstick. All you got to do swirl it around until your dry bits mix with your wet bits, and you will have in no time at all pouliche, which is the starter that we're going to use for the baguettes and the rolls.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"I like the glass containers because it gives you the opportunity to look around and make sure you didn't forget any dry bits. It all seems to be mixed in just fine, so I'm going to put the lid on, seal it, put it in a room that will not have too much sunlight and will be about room temperature, somewhere between 60 and 80 degrees, and leave it for anywhere between 10 and 16 hours, depending on the room temperature.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"All right, so the night before, this pouliche was made. As we already know, the pouliche consists of typically equal parts white flour and water, with a little bit of yeast. This will have matured for we'll say 12 hours, but it could be as much as 16, and you'll see it will rise up just like this, and at the very top of it you'll see it begin to crevasse a little bit. You'll see slight concaves and that's when the protein can no longer handle the gas and it begins to reach its full peak of maturity.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"Now that the pre-ferment is at its full stage of maturity, we're ready to mix the dough. Again, I want to add my water directly into my pre-ferment because that's going to loosen it from the container and allow me to get it out of that container very quickly and easily.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"This recipe calls for 110 grams of water. Again, I'm going to aim the water to the sides of the pre-ferment container to loosen it. We've now got 110 grams of water in our pouliche of 180 grams. It's been loosened up; it's going to come right out very easily, and whatever remains I can easily get out with my rubber spatula, no problem.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"As always with my pre-ferments and my water, I like to break them up together, stir them together so that it's one substance without lumps. That will make it easier to mix in with the rest of the dough. So once I'm here, I'm going to convert tools, start using my stiffer instrument. You can use either a metal spoon or a wooden spoon. I like a wooden spoon. I like the way it feels.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"When you're measuring your yeast, you'll see in my recipes they often call for really small portions of yeast and that's because you don't need very much yeast to make this process happen. Unless you have a scientific scale at home and you can get into 0.02 or 0.2 grams of yeast, what I would suggest is just using a pinch and this is what a pinch looks like. That was it. That was a pinch of yeast. That's going to be sufficient to get this dough moving as we want it to. I'm going to stir that in just a little bit.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"The next thing I'm going to add in is my white flour, but let's make sure that we've got accurate measurements here. We'll place on the scale, tare to zero and in comes 225 grams of white wheat flour. Tare to zero again. I'm going to add my rye flour now, which will be 25 grams. Okay, tare to zero to scale my salt. The salt going in will be 9 grams. You always want to be careful how much salt you're putting in here. Too much will slow down your dough and it's won't ferment the right way, too little and it won't taste right, so it's probably the most crucial ingredient to be very precise with your scaling.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"I'm going to start by stirring from the middle. What that will do is allow some dry matter to stay on the outside and that I'm going to reserve for the rolling and tucking process. This one has a lot of white flour in it so you're going to get a lot of gluten development, protein development early on, and that's going to make the dough want to climb up your spoon a little bit and that's okay.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"It does make the dough a little bit difficult to incorporate some of the other dry matter, some of the other flour, but that's all right. During the rolling and tucking process it's all going to become part of the same dough.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"I'm going to put the remaining flour on the surface, and the dough on top. You want to make sure to get it all in there. Okay, so I'm going to use my spatula, my scraper to stretch the dough out a little bit so that it doesn't stick to my hand too much. You'll find some of these drier clumps like this. This is completely normal. You just want to put that on the inside of the dough as you do your rolling and tucking, and that will help to incorporate that in and hydrate any part that's still dry.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"Again, using my scraper so that the dough doesn't stick so much to my hands is an easy way to save time. It keeps me from having to clean my hands over and over. I'll have to do that for the first couple roll and tucks. Again, ending seam up, flattening down into a rectangle, and any of my little chunks will go into the middle of the dough as I begin my next roll and tuck. Tuck, tuck, tuck.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"Doing this process of rolling and tucking is developing the strength of the dough, developing the protein that's going to hold in those little gas bubbles as the yeast is fermenting the flour, and those little gas bubbles will become what we refer to as the crumb of the bread or that soft interior with the little bubbles in there. This process is important to do several times to make sure that you've developed the strength of the dough sufficiently to retain the gas.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"I'm going to do the roll and tuck process on this dough about 10 times. It's a slightly stiffer dough, meaning it's got less water in it so it won't have to be done as many times, and then once that's complete we're going to let the dough rest at room temperature for about 45 minutes before we give it its next stage, which will be the stretch and fold. Give it one last one for good measure, picking up any dry bits that may remain on the surface, and that's good, slightly rounded. A little bit of pan spray in the bottom of the bowl so it doesn't stick. Again, we're going to cover this with either a wet cloth or plastic wrap and this will stay at room temperature for 45 more minutes before we give it its next stage, which is going to be the stretch and fold.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"At this stage we're going to be folding the baguette dough and it has sat out for roughly 45 minutes at room temperature. That is your indicator of when this dough is ready. You could give it as much as an hour before the first fold, but you really don't want to give it much more than that in that the folding process is designed to strengthen the dough. If you ferment the dough too long before you've folded it, you actually begin to break down some of those proteins and you're not taking advantage of the fermentation process. What we want to do is utilize a combination of time and temperature to arrive at the ideal scenario for developing strength in our dough.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"I'm going to add a little bit of flour to the top. This dough is stiffer than any of the other doughs and so I'm going to gently, gently pull at it, but I want to be careful not to tear it. It can tear pretty easily at this stage.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"You see I'm sort of flipping it back and forth. I don't know if you've ever watched people make Neopolitano pizza but sometimes they'll do it in these little tiny, tiny spaces and instead of doing that classic thing where you see somebody tossing a pie in the air, they will just flip it back and forth like this. We want to do it in a way that yields us a rectangular or square piece of dough, and we do not want to tear it so be sensitive to what the dough is doing in your fingers; make sure that you're not making any small holes.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"Now from here, we're going to do the folding process, which works where I fold one third to the middle, the next third over that third, and then I pat it down and we'll do that process again, thus giving it six layers from this one. That looks like this. One fold over, the next third goes over that. I pat that down a little bit. Then one third over ... I'll do it from this direction. One third over, pat that down and one third over. Now my dough is six times as strong as it was just a few seconds ago.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"This has to ferment for another 45 minutes at room temperature and it will be ready for its second fold.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"All right, here we are with the baguette dough once again. It is time for its second and final fold. Very easy, just like before. You can really feel that the dough has taken some strength from the last fold. Again, we don't want to tear the dough but it's going to be a lot more resistant than it was before, so give it a gentle pull in all directions, once again creating the larger rectangle that we'll then fold up. From here, one third to the middle, one third to the middle, one third to the middle, and the final third over. It's done, and this will be ready to shape in 20 minutes, but in the meantime, we're going to leave it at room temperature to make sure that it ripens and is perfectly ready to shape to what we're looking for in petit pain and baguette.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"We're going to take our Potosi dough and we're going to shape it into rolls. I like to have a scale for this. It makes the job a little bit easier so you get a consistent weight on all of them.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"You want to touch the dough as little as possible in this process. You don't want to have a roll that's got 45 different pieces of dough in it. You ideally have one piece of dough with maybe another piece on top to get your weight. We're shooting for about 45 grams.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"In this case you'll see we have a little bit of extra dough so what you can do to make sure you're not wasting any dough is try to evenly place little bit of dough in each of the rolls. This way they should come out to be the same size.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"Now, in shaping this shape for petit pain, you're going to want to start with a really simple round and that's the same method that you would use to shape a roll, a standard roll, and that's going to be either inward ... You're either wax on or wax off, either inward this way or outward this way. Either way, you want to keep it consistent and you want to let the surface of the table act almost like a third hand that's helping you to round off that dough. The way that looks like is me applying a little bit of pressure downwards onto the table and the dough will stick to the table a little bit as I apply round pressure and that will create a rounded shape. I'm going to do that with all of these. This is the pre-shape and we'll get to the final shape here in just a second.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"Okay, now that we've got our pre-shape done, we're going to do the final shape and for that I like to have a little bit of flour on the surface so that I can dip the top of the bread into that flour, then I pat it down. I roll over once, twice, three times and pinch the seam together, and then with the natural curve of my hands I'm going to roll out the final shape of the petit pain.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"This will get loaded with the seam up onto a cloth inside of a pan, and it could be any type of cloth really that's a natural fiber. In most bakeries we use linen but I've seen people use hemp. I've seen people use cotton, muslin, whatever you've got. Using the natural curvature of the hand, it comes out perfect every time.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"One, two, three and pinch the seam. There we go.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"Here's the crease that I'm going to put between these petits pains. This will help to make sure that they don't stick to each other, and having that fabric right next to them also helps to keep them moist during the fermentation process, and that looks like this. Voila. Once I finish shaping all of these, I'm going to go ahead and lay the cloth over the top and that will help to ensure that the moisture stays inside.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"After I finish off all of these, we're going to give them maybe a few minutes at room temperature just to relax into their shape, then they'll go into the refrigerator where they'll sit for about 16 hours or so.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"Okay, so we're going to load the oven at 460 degrees and we're going to immediately reduce the temperature to 440, and that's going to go for about 12, 13 minutes, thereabouts. I'm going to keep my eye on it and make sure we don't go too far with the bake.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"Want to make sure to leave a little space between each one so they've got room to expand and grow. All right, and one score from ear to ear should do it just fine. There we go.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"Now we're going to pull the petits pains out of the oven.\r\n\"\r\n\t\"They smell fantastic. These will cool very quickly so we'll be ready to eat these within the next hour, and there we are. There we are. This is my Pains Potosi and they're the small bread from rural Bolivia.\r\n\"", "equipment": [{"guid": "502bbebe-5ad0-497e-acc8-bcd99e2ba53e", "name": "Digital scale with metric measurements",
